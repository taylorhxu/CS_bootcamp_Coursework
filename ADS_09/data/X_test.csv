And they deserve to be, if for no other reason than salvaging a little of the

has fallen in love with these perennial losers. The Cubs have more fans
in Chicago then some teams do worldwide. The Cubs have more fans
worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined.
An aura of excitement surrounds the Cubs at the beginning of the season
like no one else. (including the WS champs) It must be that Eternal Hope.

Major League Baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter
attention spans (i.e. the football crowd). (-:  Invariably, all the
arguments from people who don't like to watch baseball on T.V. say the
same thing:  the games are too long and too boring.  Baseball is trying
to find a way to shorten the games for wider T.V. appeal.  If you look at
it, though, baseball games last around the same amount of time as football
games.  The difference is that there is ""more action"" in that duration in
football games.  Perhaps if there were ""more action"" in baseball games, you
would get more of those fans to tune in.  Anyway, coming up with a solution
to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult.
[On soapbox] Yet another reason to get a commisioner NOW since it's obvious
that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in
Nebraska. [Off soapbox]
How can you say there is more action in Football then Baseball. A Football
Game consists of approximately 120 plays and the average duration of a play
is around 8 seconds. This means that in a Game that lasts approximately 3
hours you have about 16 minute s of action. In a baseball game you have
upwards of two hundred pitches. There are very few on field strategy
on field stratgy sessions (ie. huddles) and you always have a chance to win
until the last out is made.
Ah, but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and
a sense of urgency because of the game clock (not all the time, but it happens
when there's less than 5 minutes to go quite often).  This sense creates
drama, even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's
attention.  In baseball, only 3 players are involved in the action for about
(here comes a wild guess) 70% of the time?  And they're just playing a
sophisticated game of catch/hold-the-ball/step-out-of-the-box/adjust-chains/
touch-self-in-interesting-locations.  There's a lot of ""dead time"" with the
players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the
mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher
who then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans
will appreciate that one).  To the non baseball junkie this is boring.
At any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid
fan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on
T.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie.  That's what Major
League Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of
shortening the game.  It's because of T.V. not because ""football has more
action than baseball"".

My question to you all is why does the media seem to embrace the theme of the
death of baseball so strongly?  I have seen articles of a similar vein in
the Chicago Tribune and in sports editorials on tv.
Maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are
responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom.
These allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times, losing
money, bankruptcies at an alarming rate, and there's going to be an
increased degradation of the product they produce.  Could you imagine
IBM, with all their problems, promoting themselves the way Major League
Baseball does?  Their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths (not
that they are too far from it now :-).  What would happen at GM?  Where
would GM be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an
inferior product because of alleged labor problems? I think it shows a
lack of confidence for the people who run the game.
Anyway, it just frustrates me when the media says such things, because it
inevitably leads to owners trying quick fixes like increasing play-offs to
satisfy television or trying interleague play to drum up interest.
Forget it.  Word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about
a done deal.  It has to be decided soon since negotiations with the
networks also have to begin soon.

NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.
1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern
2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all
3.  Houston Astros -Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2
4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993
5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants
6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink
7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.
NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting
what I said in my NL West comment.)
ALCS  New York d. Minnesota
World Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be

I guarantee that if Bonds wins the MVP the Giants will finish higher
than 6th.

As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't
believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good

season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to
use.
Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for
argument's sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below
expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I
tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but
I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are
any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can
look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).
Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although
there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was
given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what
you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the
next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at
age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,
and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was
performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being ""rushed"";
Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have
been less likely to give up on him.
Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But
does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts
performing up to expectations?

Of *course* they left RBIs off; we're comparing Alomar the individual with

I forgot.  Most runs are scored by players stealing home, so RBI don't

Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with
nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?
Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good.  I use the phrase ""happened to be"" advisedly.
Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to ""turn it up a notch"" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and
what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an
ability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who
tend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base
end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position.
My mistake.
I agree.
Me, too... RBI are a worthless stat. Of course, so is stolen bases because
sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. And of
course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases,
so batting average, slugging and obp out, too.  Hmmm... i guess homers would
not count then, either.
My point? RBI might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. And no stat (or lack
of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. Maybe no stat CAN tell me,
either, but some people are... I just know it!!! 8)

because Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to
accomodate the stadium.  I don't have an opinion just yet, just letting

Neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon, however, because

Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we
have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our
decisions on.
Do you really have *that* much information on him?  Really?
Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an
absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.
I don't know.  You tell me.  What percentage of players reach or
exceed their MLE's *in their rookie season*?  We're talking about
1993, you know.
As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the

season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent
season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to

If that were your purpose, maybe.  Offerman spent 1992 getting
acclimated, if you will.  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price
that season.  Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road.
Do you really think they would have done what they did if they
were competing for a pennant?
Lopez was hitting .588 over 17 AB when he was cut from spring
training.  What does he have to do to earn a chance?  Maybe not a full
time job, but at least a couple starts and a few AB for him to prove
his worth?
The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he
hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him
down ""until he gets warmed up"".
For a stat-head, I'm amazed that you put any credence in spring
training.  Did you notice who he got those 10 (!) hits off of, or
are you going to tell me that it doesn't make a difference?
The kid *will* improve playing at AAA,
Just like Keith Mitchell did?
Wait a minute.  I missed something here.  First, forget Keith
Mitchell.  Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA
and then does not improve would have been better off making a
direct leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then
does not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't
belong in the bigs?
Now, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)
he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was
returned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now
his career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your
point.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now
he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.
Duh.
That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they
really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,
or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization.
Well, I've cast my lot.  Certainly you may understand better how
good Lopez is.  And I may overvalue experience.  But neither one
of us runs a baseball team.

two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy.
2) Is it probable that I'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or
3) on game day? I figure since it's early in the year, Ryno's out and
the weather isn't great I should be able to get tickets. If not, what's
the best way to get advance tickets; can I call the Cubs' ticket office
directly and pick up tickets at the will call window?
3) Any advice on where to eat before or after the game?
4) Do they allow inflatable I-luv-ewe dolls (present from Lundy) into the
bleachers? :-)

The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have

Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style
of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.
(Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once

seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the
early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums

Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at
least in *their* opinion.
Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base.
They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly
promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they
want to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!
I disagree, in that I don't think it *is* a _tangible_ skill, any more than
leadership is.  I don't deny that it is a *real* skill, and that some catchers
may be much better than others at it, but I really don't see any way that we
could ever know who they are.  Nichols's Law of Catcher Defense is eerily
accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very
seriously.
Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.
""A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his
recent offensive level of performance.""  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in
the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger
in two short years.  The rule doesn't apply to perceived ""superstars"", who
get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably
considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.
Don't believe in catchers'
era.  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers.
Aren't they the same thing?
In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind
a different decision than we would make must be financial.
Either that or just stupidity.
I presume
we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta, no?
Of course.
Is it fair to the young players?  No.  Does it make organizational sense?
I think it does.
Well if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them
for their decisions.  I mean, please don't tell me how to run my
business.  Especially when I'm being successful.
One could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in
pursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media
magnet).  The Reds made a lot of money off that; they also wasted the prime
of Eric Davis.  That may be ""good business"", but that doesn't mean I don't
loathe them for it.

I agree, though I'd also be happy with a stadium that looks
like new Comiskey. The new park was also made for baseball.
Unlike Three Rivers, the Vet, Riverfront, etc., it's not a
football park in which they also play baseball.
While we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget Shea, which
was designed to accommodate both the Mets & Jets.  It was the first
stadium (I think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball & in parallel for football.
Not the first.  RFK, olim DC Stadium, was built 2 years earlier.
Nowadays they don't move the seats back for the few exhibition
games; but the 3rd-base/LF lower deck used to move.  It was all
metal, which was pretty noisy on Bat Day.
Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football
stadium), the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where,
because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the
action.  The Mets announcers--Kiner & Murphy in particular--have
always hyped it as ""beautiful Shea
Stadium,"" a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.
It's vastly better than it was before they fixed it, though.  Back in
the late 70's it was a *dump*.

Does anybody know what is going on with Lankford? I know he was

His performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury
received when he ran into the wall making a catch in the Cincy series.
It may also be him pressing a little.
As for the baserunning, it does not appear to be just Lankford.
Dent made the bad call sending Lankford in the Sunday night game
against Cincy - but everyone had a bad time against the Dodger's catcher.
Whereis the Ray Lankford we saw last year???
Good question.  At least it doesn't appear that we are seeing the

Greg,
The story goes like this:
Spanky is too slow!  If he were quicker, he would still be here.
But with Slaught and Tom Prince, they didn't want to lose Prince in order
to bring up that 11th pitcher.  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
Prince is coming along nicely!
Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to
release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year?  Yes, I know
he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than
Slaught, but that doesn't answer the question.  If Slaught was so obviously
better this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he
have been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties?

Well, I don't want shorter games *per se*, but I would like for them to stop
*wasting* so much time during games. The Gant incident is a perfect example.
When a guy comes to the plate, he should be up there to hit, not show off
(or show up the umpire, which is clearly what Gant was doing). I feel like
writing a fan letter to Hirschbeck.

When Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant
to step into the box.  IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck
was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game.
Gant wasn't dawdling; he hadn't had a chance to dawdle.  And Hirschbeck
was simply exercising a power play.  Gant resisted, as many of
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and
Hirschbeck called for the pitch.  At that point, Cox came out on
the field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the
dugout.  Cox was tossed ""protecting his player"".  I was pleasantly
surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.
Did you see the same game I saw? Gant, most reasonable, argued a
horrible call which Hirschbeck, correctly, did nothing about. Gant
then proceeded to walk halfway to 3rd base, lean on his bat and
glare at Hirschbeck. While I don't necessasarily subscribe to the
theory of showing people up, this was an obvious attempt by Gant to
do so to Hirschbeck. He left Hirschbeck no choice but to take control
of the situation. The bottom line is: Gant started a dangerous
power struggle with Hirschbeck when his team needed him most and
he lost.
The events I saw were:
1)  Called strike by Hirschbeck
2)  Shocked-looking Gant asks for appeal to first
3)  No appeal to first
4)  Gant steps out of batters box.
5)  Hirschbeck *immediately* orders Gant back in.  [bad move]
6)  Gant ignores Hirschbeck and walks off. [bad move]
7)  Hirschbeck yells at Gant.  Gant is silent.
8)  Hirschbeck calls for the pitch.
9)  Pitch is called a strike.
10)  Cox argues (couldn't see when he came on the field)
11)  Cox is ejected, players everywhere
12)  Play finally resumes.
Gant shouldn't have ignored Hirschbeck.  Not returning made the strike
call fairly likely.  Although I suspect an argument might have gotten
Gant tossed altogether.  But if Hirschbeck had let Gant step out, the
whole incident probably would have been avoided.

Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both
shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.
Not.

certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential
candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to
the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?
No, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth?
Not really.  But he obviously belongs there.
The Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As
more players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.
And, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield,
etc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability
throughout most of his career.
Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know
what you mean.
As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters
tend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't
lead MLB history in walks allowed, either.

Cardinal fan:
In article <93095@hydra.gatech.EDU gt7469a@prism.gatech.EDU (Brian R. Landmann) writes:
Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.
He's not the greatest - this is true.
For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,
I saw it.
With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.
Lankford was hurt, although the announcer said he told Torre he
could pinch hit if they needed him to.
Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hell
is he thinking.
I wondered the same thing.  But giving Joe the benefit of the
doubt, I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that
he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his
speed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely
confused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that
particular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?
Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said
he liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year,
what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every
team in the league.
Well, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing
but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play
Jordan ahead of him.  That I don't quite understand.
Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate,
The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home,
Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm
going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's
got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter -
coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign
in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.
It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin
was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.
BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third
and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the
replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a
serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year
and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.
I can't take this anymore
Well, I'm still hanging in there.

Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with
nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?
Actually, for the Padres this year so far it's 23%.  They are 5th in
the league in HRs, and ALL have been solo shots.
Pythagorean projection puts them at .360 winning percentage
or 58-104.  Need some pitching help, fast!
Good news, though, is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs

second basemen in history. He probably didn't even have as good a season as
Alomar last year.
Guess which line is which:
The walks should give it away.  OBP's, in general, somewhat more valuable than
slugging, and Alomar's edge in OBP was quite a bit larger than Baerga's edge
in slugging.
I'm no SDCN, but what's more valuable:
28 hits w/5 more doubles, 12 more HRs   OR
7 more triples and 52 BBs?  (Let's not forget the 39 extra SBs. How many CS?)
Of course the 28 hits and 12 homers are more valuable.
But don't forget the 58 outs.  You can't have it both ways; Baerga's higher
raw numbers are due to him having more playing time, and thus he had more
hits and homers, but don't forget the cost of those outs.
(BTW, just to answer your question, Alomar had 49 SB and 9 CS; Baerga had
10 SB and 2 CS, which gives a minute plus on Alomar's side.)
Something else to consider:
Alomar's H-R splits were .500-.363 SLG, .444-.369 OBP! Baerga's was .486-.424
and .392-.318. Pretty clearly, Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park.
I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P
rated Baerga higher, actually.

"Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated
pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over
New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started
with a solid single to right, moved to second on ""Bob"" Kelly's infield sneaker
down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a
rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.
Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only
given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double
by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after
Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who
argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by ""drawing the line"" (really, he
should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting
tossed.
The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must
have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's
single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell
and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson
failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:
Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield
to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:
Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.
(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)
The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's
ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back
singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long
fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but
third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was
hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.
Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner
on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game
in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on
Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended
up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a
week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went
to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings
work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit
surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.
The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory
today.  The Mets are 6-5.

"You want to speed up ballgames?
1.  Enforce the two minutes between innings.  As it is, many fields are
allowing THREE minutes between them.  Fifteen seconds before
TV commercials are gone to, Thirty or so before action begins upon
the return to the game.  Two minutes, last out to first pitch, or
a ball is called.
2.  Don't grant time to batters just because they want it.  They may get
pissed at first, but they'll get in line, once anything the pitcher
throws while they're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.
3.  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches (the current
rule is too lenient), and then enforce it.  Fifteen seconds is more
than enough time.  If the pitch isn't released in 15, call it a ball,
and restart the clock.
Baseball games take about 2:51 in the NL, and just a shade under 3 hours
in the AL.  That's just too damn long.  I don't like to PLAY in 3 hour
games, much less WATCH a game for that long.  My butt falls asleep, and
if I'm watching on TV, I'll channel surf between pitches, catching

Roberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.  Or maybe a

Dennis Bennett was the 4th starter.
They were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two
games after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory
(Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the
title; they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards, with the
Giants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead
against the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way

"Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat
shaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three
picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning
and blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).
Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont
be taken lightly.  Going into today's game, the had the league's leading
hitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young
and Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.

I wholeheartedly endorse it.
I have no problem with the
length of games at all and am tired of the ESPN crowd ( and other announcers )
bitching about it. I have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking
at their watches and shouting ""Hurry up!""  If I cough up big bucks for a
ticket, I don't mind a game that last more than 2:10.  I really don't
understand it.
Haven't been to many A's games, have you?
Seriously, I don't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts
a long time because there is good baseball being played.  However, I don't
like 3-2 games that take 3+ hours, because there's a lot of dead time going
on in that game.  I don't find anything exciting about watching batter or
pitcher wander around between pitches, or watching the catcher make a slow
walk to the mound, or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason
(Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this; the game could be way out of
reach, and he'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).
I want to see the game, not people standing around.  I don't really enjoy
watching NFL football games in person, for example, because there's so much
dead time (you don't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch
it on television, because they're busy showing you replays).  I don't like
that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game
(the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next
year: they're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next
year, and they're going to a 35 second clock).
There's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm
watching them on the tube, and if I'm going there in person.  For me, going
to an A's game has become a major commitment of time, one that I'm not
willing to make that often:  the length of their games is costing the A's
revenue from me.

Not an astute observation -- this is a straw-bullpen.  The lefties,
Stanton & Mercker are strong, and Wohlers is down learning a new pitch.
The bullpen is fine, probably superior.

would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.

impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's
reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the
AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he
pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.

bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.
Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at
the plate in his rookie year.
4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that
Walk desrved his contract.
5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I
can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through
waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.
Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught
should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed
pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to
trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere
wasn't very fit last year.
6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!
7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the
season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other
than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,
Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have
pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money
on Patterson in stead.
8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.
9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.
10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his
value has increased immensely.
11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.
Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.
Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better
than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.
12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement
in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.
13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The
RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace
two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a
very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have
a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit
left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options
for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was
getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.
14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.
they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.
Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,
nothing else will.
On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2
starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of
the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the
season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked
in the second half of the last 2 seasons)

FROM:   Karim Edvard Ahmed <ka0k+@andrew.cmu.edu
Since I haven't been able to keep up with baseball much this season, I
have a few questions about my favorite team, the Minnesota Twins:
1.  How good does their rotation look?  The last I heard, the order is
Tapani, Erikson, Mahomes, Banks, and some guy I've never heard of.
(sounds pretty pathetic to me)
Well, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who ""hasn't
matured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old
who is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and
have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim
Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies
hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has
gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven.
I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.
2.  Who is playing short and third?
Well, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but
was a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is
split (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry
Jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3
years.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be
happy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they
might give too much time to Pags.
3.  How's Winfield doing?
Sorry, can't help you here.

Apologies if I don't know what I'm talking about :-), but as a Twins fan,
I like to think they have good players in any park.  Not sure if I remember
completely or not, but I think Gaetti played with the Twins in '87 for the
world series, and again in '88 (note that's his lowest of the 4).  I believe
the next 3 (or at least the last two) were played with the Angels.   Lots
of factors make a player excell...  I hate it when so many use the dome.

Your speculation that the two proven veterans will produce better

Obviously, the Braves believe they can win with the catching they

"To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism, I am having a
contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox' fall from their current
heights.  You must decide first, whether the Sox will be at .500 again
at any time during this year.  Then you must predict either:
(1) Their record the first time they're at .500, if they are, or
(2) Their final record, if they stay above .500 the rest of the year.
So Valentine's earlier prediction would go as ""13-13"" (resend it if you
were serious, Val!).
ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was
in 1952, when they finished 76-78, in sixth place.

Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.
For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,
With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.
That's because Lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games
before that
and was day-to-day... only available as a pinchrunner.
Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hell
is he thinking.
See above.
Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said
he liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year,
what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every
team in the league.
At the beginning of the interview Torre also said Lankford is the
one outfield
guy who's ""in there no matter what"".
My guess is Jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low
on base percentage.  Whiten was a great acquisition... decent offense
and great defense in rightfield.  But don't worry, Gilkey will be
starting
as soon as Jordan or Whiten displays an extended period of low offensive
output.

Sorry Len, this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs.
Being overweight and having no work ethic, leading to being injury prone with

"I just wanted to let everyone know that I have lost what little respect I have
for Jim LeFebvre after seeing today's Cubs game. First of all how could he
start Maldonado over May. After the way May played at the end of last year and
the way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench? Not
to mention that a right hander (Maddux) started. I really blew my top when
Lefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS! How can you do that
just because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. Wilkins is
twice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, one
of the weakest hitters I have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat all
day, and Lefebre let him hit, while May still sat the bench. I think even Arnie
Harris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout while
Vizcaino was batting. Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in
baseball.

I gots ta know.
Dummy Hoy, a late 19th-Century baseball player, was deaf.  In
order for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or
strike, the umpires developed hand signals.  This also helped to relieve
the stress on umpires' vocal cords, so they didn't have to shout ""STRIKE!!!""

Now that time has passed, what would the posts be like if Rickey were driving
his boat drunk, killing himself and one of his teammates?  What would people
say if Bonds, drunk out of his skull, smashed his car into a tree disabling
himself &, say, Willie McGee for the season?  I can tell you.  They would be
considered spoiled, lazy (say it) niggers.
This awfully presumptious of you, to assume you can read our minds and
predict the future.  What makes you so sure I would be thinking these things?
What makes you think that there's not a lot of people out there don't think
Crews is a god?  Anyone who is dead because of a mistake deserves sympathy, be
it Crews, Olin, Bonds, McGee, Rickey, or you, or me.Why does it bother you so
much that two dead white men are getting a little sympathy? Would it make you
feel better if we only mourned dead black baseball players?
To beat a dead horse, I seem to remember a fair amount of sympathy for
some black fringe player named Roberto Clemente.  And for Roy
Campanella.  And for Thurman Munson.  And for just about anyone else
who we may not even have liked as players, but mourned for dying too young.
Wiggins, Alan?
But that's besides the point.  I'm sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic for Rickey if he were killed.  But, they would also be
criticizing him a lot more for his actions.
Example?
How about Jose Canseco?  He gets a couple of speeding tickets, and all
of the sudden his attitude is awful.  What the hell do speeding tickets
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway?  So why do sportswriters
talk about it all the time.
Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell?  Both of whom had DWI problems
towards the end of last year.  (Two years ago?)  It was cited as a sign
of their immaturity, etc.
Meanwhile, Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton, and I didn't
read any sportswriter complaining about that.  They may have talked
about how bad it was for the Phillies, but I NEVER read anywhere
criticism of Dykstra's character (or Daulton's intelligence, for that
matter) based on this incident.

I dont know about the story but it comes from the fact that in most stadiums, the batter faces northeast and so when

Duh.
Methinks you recall wrong. Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and
continued to walk alot after his promotion. He was then (I think) left
off the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where
even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad
at going back down.
he struggled last year, no doubt, but even the Braves blamed part of it
on the demotion. I'd much rather have Mitchell than say Mark Whiten on

Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms.  I
remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my
guess he was wearing the exact same duds.
The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have
reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets
insgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is the
first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me
a little of the Dodger logo.
As far as I know, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York (NL) change their
uniforms every year.  Every other year (e.g., New York), it will say Mets
in cursive, New York in cursive, or New York in all caps.  Minor changes,
but they do change them often.  Last year, I think they had New York in all
caps.  Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year?  What about
Pittsburgh?
Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style
of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.
(Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once
bright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has also
seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the
early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums
construcrted throughout the sixties.
I hate the gray.  They should opt for more color (like the White Sox).
I hate white team versus gray team.  Spring training uniforms look much
better.
With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one
in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the

Of course, if we didn't have government monopolies on cellular phone service,
there probably *would* be some available.
How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of
providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making

The Second and Fourth Amendments do come to mind.
The Second Amendment is especially apt, given the ITAR definitions of

voice communications, will be distributed only through the
""underground"".  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that
they are protecting their privacy.
Some thoughts:
Has any work been done on encapsulating encrypted data inside ""non-encrypted""
data files?  Many file formats can be written with ""gaps"" in them to hide
other data.  New file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden
by dispersing it amongst the ""legitimate"" data.  The hidden data would only
show up with the right key(s), and a file with hidden data would be
indistinguishable from one without.  So, only the correct key(s) would reveal
the presence of an ""illegal"" document.
If I devise a custom file compression algorithm and only I and a friend have
the uncompressor, and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish, do I
have the right to transmit the file?  Will we have to ""escrow"" all our data
file formats?  Are gangs required to escrow their hand signals, colors and

Encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than ski

ensures his own privacy and is _not_ crippled by a key-escrow system.
I guess I'm looking for a ``League for Cryptographic Freedom.'' Or a
``National Cryptography Association.''
An excellent idea.
To what extent does the EFF serve this purpose? Is a new organization
necessary? Does it already exist?
While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF,
from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for
strong cryptography through a distinct organization.
The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex
and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the
contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged
models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin
already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one
step removed from the old ""crypto-wielding child molester"" argument.  An
EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the
connection to child pornography and the like.
Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In
light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it
stands to be labelled as ""communist"", ""anarchist hackers"", radical, etc.
I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social
Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical
antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political
baggage.
Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography
would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing
group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to
advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's
question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going
to do about it?
Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,
I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:
gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the
issue as well as the First-Amendment side.

My MDC cipher (which uses any one-way hash function as a CFB-mode stream

(that is, you can use a 1-bit key if you want and copy it over the entire
2048-bit range, or you can use the entire 2048 bits).  Runtime is
independant of key size, the system runs slightly slower than MD5 itself.
I presume RC2 and RC4 use a similar system (or possibly they just hash an

develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be
lobbied against it, from within and from without.  If you work for a
telecommunications equipment vendor, first enlist the aid of your
coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative, and then
present your company's management with a united front of engineering
talent against this initiative.  Write persuasive memos to your
management, with your name and your colleagues' names on it.  Hold
meetings on it.
One way to do this might be to suggest that these companies should be
implementing their own schemes, not being limited to the govt's
scheme.
I find that most of my reasons for opposition to the CLipper scheme
are algoritm insecurity and mistrust of the govt/NSA.  These are hard
to sell in letters to the editor and to nontechnical people.  Any

Yes, but will they buy you a ticket on a time machine to allow you to

It is unclear whether obtaining the key at time 0 also unlocks
messages recorded (by whomever) at earlier times. The announcement was
silent on this. The betting seems to be that once your key has been
obtained (by the authorities, by divorce lawyers, by the Mafia, by the
FBI, by lost or stolen backup tapes, by the NSA, etc.). all previous
conversations are unsecure. (Session keys are negotiated, but knowing
the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the
security. No doubt more details will emerge.)
So, the loss of a key, whether one is guilty or innocent, may mean a lot
more than merely replacing the phone.
Sort of like saying to someone, ""Oh, I copied your diary. But I'll buy
you a new one.""
And the system, if made mandatory (as I expect), will make such
storing of conversations much easier, I fear. For one thing, the
transmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyone
listening, a kind of ""Caller ID"" and ""Callee ID"" on a grand scale.
Also, the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the
privacy of the calls, as they perceive them all to be useless
encrypted junk. (This is a bit of a reach, I know, suggesting that the
Clipper will make security more lax...).

The U.S. does NOT have an official secrets act. We do have laws that

_automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself.  I believe you

A less serious example: if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are

Advances in digital computing have made it possible for ordinary people to
use powerful machine cipher techniques.
It is tempting (albeit chauvinistic) to believe that we have a new situation
here, thanks to our pet computers.  This is not true.  David Kahn's ""The
Codebreakers"", a history of cryptography, makes two things obvious:
1.	Cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals
and has been going on for thousands of years.  [Teen-age slang and
cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous
creation.]
2.	The systems people created on their own were roughly as secure as (and
sometimes more secure than) those used by military and diplomatic
users *of that time* (although they seem very simple and insecure
today). [e.g., In places, the Bible used a more complex simple
substitution than Caesar did for his military dispatches, but before
Caesar.]
I commend Kahn's book to all who might be interested.

another of the dirty tricks they used to apply on us under the

In my previous messages I wrote that the Americans should wake up and

As one of the happily sleeping people, I would just like to ask this-
aren't people just slightly overreacting to this?  Or are we all of a

The point of the matter is that; yes this is a serious problem.  But it is
not the end of the world.  Guess what?  We're doing something now you
can't do in a Communist country or Nazi Germany.  We're complaining about
it, (or rather, you're complaining about it) and nobody is shooting at us.
(Or, rather, if they're shooting at me, they have real bad aim.  (:-) )
GUESS WHAT PEOPLE?  You live in one of the few countries in the world
where a person can complain without getting shot at.
People are always complaining that somebody did this wrong, or somebody
did that wrong, or whatever.  Sit down and figure out two things:
1)  What have they done right?
2)  How much worse can it get?
And you'll find that you and I, are pretty damn lucky.
So let's talk about it, get some action going, decide what's going on.
But let's not overreact!

"The key question is whether non-Clipper encryption will be made illegal.
The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption
threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have
effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every
American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a
false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is
an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper
Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.
The clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans
have the right to Clipper encryption, but not to unbreakable encryption.
This implies that, ultimately, non-Clipper strong encryption must become
illegal.
(As an aside, isn't the language here jarring?  All this talk about
""harmonious balance"" when they're talking about taking away people's
right to communications privacy?)
Although the article emphasizes voice communication, data and mail encryption
is mentioned as well:
Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.
--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;
It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Denning's proposals
are coming true.  If the government continues on this course, I imagine
that we will see strong cryptography made illegal.  Encryption programs
for disk files and email, as well as software to allow for encrypted
voice communications, will be distributed only through the
""underground"".  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that
they are protecting their privacy.
It's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.

"The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack
against DES is quite feasible now. But normally DES is applied in CBC or CFB
mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes. Questions:
- Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key? Then we have
a 56 + 64 = 120 bit key.
- If yes: Is anything known about the security of this key scheme? Can we
break it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space?

I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the

police investigation.  That is, ignoring concerns about government
intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to
investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry,
and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?
A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million
dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S.
wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28
billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].)
I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but
I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating
the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.
Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:
- How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all
phones with wiretap chips?
- How much would it cost to make each chip?
- How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place?
- How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip?
- What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been
if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs?
- What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed
""law enforcement blocks""?
- What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?
Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police
agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being
charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication
to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or
would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes
in other ways?

Maybe use the dollars/life lost calculations for the extra people

Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specificall

Why doing it in such a rough manner? It is much more professional to
steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a
pin-compatible do-nothing chip that does not encrypt at all. Chances
are that the victim will not notice anything, especially if it is done
professionally.
Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate
with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from
key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.
No, because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations.
True, they'll blame the wrong guys, but nevertheless one cannot say
something like ""The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus'""
when the Feds are listening, even if they cannot identify who the
speaker is.
No, the criminals will just use some secure encryption. The new
proposal does not stop criminals; it ensures that the government will
be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper.
To me, it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other
strong encryption devices.

"Generally, an organization has influence in proportion to:
The narrowness of its objectives
The number of members
The strength of belief of its members
This is why the pro- and anti-abortion groups are so strong: narrow objectives,
lots of interested members who are real passionate.
For this reason, mixing with the NRA is probably a bad idea.  It diffuses
the interests of both groups.  It may well diminish the Passion Index
of the combined organization.  It is not clear it would greatly enlarge
the NRA.
So, I believe a new organization, which may cooperate with NRA where the
two organization's interest coincide, is the optimum strategy.

"Here is a disturbing thought.
Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in
the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database
get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were
I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow
houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)
Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of
serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but
this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the
population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for
each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very
valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who
cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my
pocket on two 8mm tapes.
Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole
database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks
in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day
by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience
will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At
some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte
tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will
doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that ""can't"" is a
prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.
With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for
every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you
need the ""master key"" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information
that have to be stored an awful lot of places.
Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database
isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial
political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the
ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the
evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have
a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial
secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why
our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left
unexplained by those that point out this threat.)
Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA
and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened
many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some
fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.
Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on
the escrow databases.
We crypto types are all taught something very important at the
beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the
easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a
secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our
teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they
would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million
Clipper chips.
I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this
doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too
many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect
that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are
doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue
to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect
that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can
try to delay things as long as possible.
Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable
bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe
that this scheme might give people some security, even as their
subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of
it all.

"I suspect that the decisive element in the political battle will be the
FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) factor.
If the people who would be end users of the Cripple Chip hear of the whole
debate only vaguely -- the government says it's solid; other people in the
field say it's Swiss cheese -- the balance of doubt could shift against the
Feds.  Any attempt to limit other forms of encryption could then be presented
as the government covering its own butt by protecting its poor product from
superior competition.

Hmmm, this gave me an interesting idea.  How about this argument:
1)  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms.
2)  Strong cryptography is ""arms"", according to the U.S. government (that's
why it's so hard to export).
Therefore, we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography!
However, it's likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it
is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly
restricting.  Maybe the NRA _would_ be the best existing organization?

"It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you, and the escrow
houses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure.
It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are
good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.
What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you,
at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that
a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your
cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the
escrow houses.
Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are
laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to.
Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time
limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.
That's if we go with this scheme, which I am not sure I agree with.

You seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value, and that
the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them.
Given this comparatively tiny number of wiretaps, and the associated
difficulty and cost involved (judges, technicians, etc) I expect that
law enforcement reserves the use of wiretaps for the most valuable
cases.  Since the ""value"" of an arrest can vary over an enormous range
(eg. jaywalking - mass murder) I think your $5 million estimate may
be too low by a couple of orders of magnitude.

I seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would
place the onus on the individual to register keys.  Realistically, the
Clipper-Chip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier
when requesting the key fragments.  The chip manufacturer would register
this identifier code vs. key combination when the chip is made and the
(uninitiated) end-user can therefore remain completely outside the loop.
The chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device --
it really makes no difference:  When the authorities detect the use of this
encryption standard during surveillance, they would then capture the ID
and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data.

Actually, it's not quite that bad, but it's close.
Look, we (collectively) have the power to throw the bums out, but we
don't use it.  We clearly don't need to go burning things down, but we
clearly do need to throw at least some of the bums out.
Unfortunately, the bums have learned to target only small groups of
people at a single time, so the masses won't react and throw them out.
Eventually, the masses will react, unless the bums cease their
relentless encroachment on liberty and despoilment of the economy.
The sooner it happens, the less the damages will be.  I don't want to
live in a war zone, either -- I want to see the bums thrown out before

I, for one, believe that the use of civil forfeiture should be abolished by
a decent administration, not continued.  Instead, it looks like that
ill-gotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment.
I wholeheartedly agree.  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies
seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that
we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have
to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws
and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed
them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has
to be changed.
Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug
informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact
with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are
motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy
way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more
incentive for the agencies to take property.
It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that
Clinton would have the ""plumbers"" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his
henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a
leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that
control and take more.
WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the
equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.  We have to take
responsibility for ourselves, our personal welfare, and our actions.

If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses, obviously one
could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors.
I agree.  So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?
Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy
a bunch of their stuff :).
One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of
security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.
This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to
deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you
look at it :).
Indeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good
system right now. A standard codec chip, a chip to do vocoding, a DES
chip, a V32bis integrated modem module, and a small processor to do
glue work, are all you need to have a secure phone.
Great!  Where can I buy it?
Another note: If ""Clipper"" increases the incentive to bring stronger
encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at
the moment.
Yes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government.
I don't care where we *need* to get it from, I care where we *can* get it
from, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.
Indeed, were it not for the government doing everything possible to
stop them, Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to
the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for the
NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As it
is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been for
them, I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.
You can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a
restriction I firmly oppose).  The only thing stopping people from making
cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.
They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones
keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands. When they hand you a
clipper chip, what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prize
for having traded in your birthright.
Oh, come on.  Only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  A Clipper phone
*IS NOT* a substitute for a Cylink phone, or a STU-III.  It's a substitute
for the ""voice scramblers"" advertised in the back of Radio Electronics.
Are we getting cheaper crypto
for ourselves? No, because the market would have provided that on its
own had they not deliberately sabotaged it.
I disagree.  Modulo ITAR, it's not the government that has sabotaged the
market.
Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in

Right.  People here believe the government is listening in on

It's not a matter of the government listening on on everything, it's a

Say, if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at a

Par for the course, though.  I predicted that you'd be jumping in in

"April 16, 1993
Washington, DC
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
today called for the public disclosure of technical data
underlying the government's newly-announced ""Public Encryption
Management"" initiative.  The new cryptography scheme was
announced today by the White House and the National Institute
for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the
technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman
acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-
secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the
encryption technology around which the new initiative is built.
According to NIST, the technical specifications and the
Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To
open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today
filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests
with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security
Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption
plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the
Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to
open the development of non-military computer security standards
to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of
such standards.
CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in
developing the so-called ""digital signature standard"" (DSS), a
communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for
government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA
lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first
time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.
NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying
the classification of records concerning its creation of the
David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the
administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of
electronic communications, as reflected in today's official
statement,  ""a step in the right direction.""  But he questioned
the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent
secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from
public scrutiny.  ""At a time when we are moving towards the
development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital
that standards designed to protect personal privacy be
established openly and with full public participation.  It is
not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of
secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to
play a leading role in the development process.""
CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer
industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of
technology on society.   CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and
maintains offices in Palo Alto, California, Cambridge,
Massachusetts and Washington, DC.  For additional information on

"It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost
irrelevant - if I cannot choose the key, but have to use a key chosen for
me by the foundry, the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good

It is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains ALL THE KEYS EVER
MANUFACTURED - after all we are talking about 1 to 100 million keys that
will ever be manufactured. The key depositories can be as secure and
incorruptible as they wish to be, nobody cares anyway...:-(

others are impenetrable (remember: the chips have to ship with the key -
you or the dealer are going to submit it to the authorities eventually)

to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy.
More than the proposals themselves, I read the language of the press
releases, the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to
the public, and I am sickened.  I am revolted.  I am repulsed.
90%, perhaps even 95% of this country could care less about the
clipper chip, the wiretap bill, the smart card, because they are so
entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration.
This saddens and frightens me.
I am a conserveative believe it or not.  A law and order conserveative.
But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me,
mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the
intelligence of the American people.  Tell them it's going to keep
them safe from drug dealers and terrorists, and they will let you
put cameras in their home.
Even in the wake of Waco, you find those who support the increasingly
totalatarian moves.
Somebody once said something like: ""Armed Violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack.  It is not meant to be used in
agression.  This is the difference between self-defence and murder.""
To be quite honest, the way things are going, I'd call it self defense.
Let's try to avoid killing things, eh?  There's enough blood shed in the
world, without adding a couple of riots, Civil Wars, etc.
I'm probably overreacting.  But what I've read scared me a lot.  I don't

"I've got an idea that would remove most of the political complaints
I have about the Clipper chip.  Pass a law stating that if, within a
year of performaing a wiretap on someone, a police agency hasn't
managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for,
then that agency owes the suspect $1 million to repay him/her for
lost privacy.
Of course, there are *still* problems with the technical aspects of
Clipper, and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behind
an attempt to enforce it as a standard.  But this would be a way for
those in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will
only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are
all but certain that there really will be a conviction....

I think, though I don't really need to keep the monitor active (I can try to
remember what to do) so maybe I can avoid a DC-AC inverter and just use a
battery to directly supply the motherboard and peripherals.
Now there's a good idea ! All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes, and
a good (wetware) memory (was I using wp or autocad or ...). I thought of the
same idea myself a few days ago. I've got a fairly new car battery that I take
along in my 4x4 when I go camping, and it sits around useless when I'm home.
I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy
duty 5-volt regulator to supply the PC. But I guess you'd need -5v and -12v
(and +12) too (2 more batteries ?).
An alternative would be to leave a 40 AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery
and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time, and when the power
goes out, voi-la ! the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery ! and
then I could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips !-)

I have a project that was drooped in my lap that is somewhat a pain to design.
What I am looking for is a stable ultra-long solid state timer. What they want
to do is to place this thing on the Antartic ice shelf and measure the amount
of snow fall over a period of six weeks. Every two weeks, they want to trip a
selonoid to discharge different colored pellets by gas pressure out across the
snow. Then by digging down into the snow, the snow fall amount can be measured
as they come to the different color pellets.
The problem is trying to build a timer that would stand the cold (-40 degrees)
and a power source that wouldn't drain. I have looked at the XR-2204 timers and
the standard NE556 dual timers, but thier temp specs won't go that low. Also,
two weeks equates to 1,209,600 seconds per firing, which means one big timing
cap ! I have found 2.2 farad (yes, Farad !) caps that have a working voltage of
5 volts and are small in size. But again, the time of discharge at -40 or lower
degrees isn't linear. I was thinking of using several timers chained together
to fire the selonid at the end of the timing period, but that blasted cold and
the drain on a battery over six weeks is the pain. One possibility would be to
use solar panels, but this is during the six month twilight. Anyone have any
good ideas ?
Thanks in advance...
-=-= Wes =-=-
just a suggestion:
take a motorola mc14536B set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten
secs with either a RC or xtal clock input. then feed to a MC14521B as clock
input and decode output for 1,209,600 sec output ,might have to add a few 'and'
gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the'521 to restart
cycle... Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then
goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..
these ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt
gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks.
Then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3"" or 4"" of foam or build a box
of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...
build a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery
and ckts warm.
2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.
Insolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL
rated devices are good to -55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reduction
in capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..

"SO..  Here's my question.  It seems to me that I'd have the
same electrical circuit if I hooked the neutral jumper from the
neutral over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding
outlets. What's wrong with my reasoning here?
First, go to the local hardware store and pick up a copy of ""Wiring
Simplified"" by H.L. Richter.  Now if your house is wired with metal
conduit, you don't need a seperate ground wire (assuming the house
is wired correctly and the pipes are connected to a cold water
pipe in your basement).  The outlets that have a neutral hooked to
the ground screw seem wrong.  Anyone else think so?
Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company.
The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were
VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest
problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.
In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets
with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you
can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they
were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory
periodically.
With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be
less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer
recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their
equipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find
that the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, it
should be o.k. for most applications.

The simplest one is easy.  Take a lemon or other citrus type fruit, and
stick a pair of metal strips into it for the contacts.  The two strips must
be of disimelar metals like copper and zinc.  Then connect a voltmeter to
the contacts and read the voltage.

Hmmm.  How are those orange ""isolated ground"" outlets (often used in
computer rooms) wired?
They require two separate grounds.  One ground goes to the ground pin
of the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's
mounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal
faceplate, if any).
The box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground.
The outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated
busbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to
the building-entrance main ground by its own wire.
So the two separate ground systems are connected together at the
building's service entrance.  But one is also connected to every
grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,
while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged
into isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happens
to accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,
the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it
until the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated
ground will remain relatively noise-free.

probably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape. So the LED, with
each beep, would go on and off real quick, generating a strobe light sort
of effect. The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the
rapidity of the blinking of the LEDS. And if there was no sound on the tape
(except for background his), the LEDs would remain off. Please help!

MF The most obvious way I've come up with is to use analog switches

How about using a 4053 it has a seperate ground for the

MF Another part which caught my eye was the Analog Devices AD630. This
MF is a balanced demodulator which appears to fill exactly the need I

David Prutchi
First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors,
transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla
coils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean
an ""air core resonant transformer"". The TV flyback version Tesla
coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for
diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called
""Oscillating Shuttle Circuit"" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly
efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,
which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active
reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve
efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core
resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI
for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer
screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil
from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all
Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter
and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind
to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,
gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and
telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????
If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.

"I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that
something similar is on its way here.  Since we apparently
don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing
cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests
are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the
video being piped into a command center they're building
somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or
cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large
multi-colored status displays will show the various routes
using different colors to represent the various average speeds
for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front
of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic
status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also
looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to
providing continuous audio from this system.
In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display
boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data
on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the
system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it
will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is
similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read
""cheap"").
We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP
audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal
reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle
receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is
applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some
other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your
stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station
jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.
I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle
receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly
fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers
don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely
true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system
up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You
may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing
more, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)
I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more
info on how the LA system is networked and paid for.

The 7A22 has an on-board voltage offset as well as switchable high-

The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private
Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around
the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from
the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned
in front of the user's eye.
The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA
compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up
and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the
sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image
projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse
with the background.
I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I
looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking
if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.
The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found
annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly
used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.
I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in
the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.

"Anyways, I've built the basic up & down converters with pretty
good results (80% efficiency) but I'm running into problems
when I try to design & build anything that puts out serious
amps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V@200A guts on my
bench) but something puzzles me: I'm using a simple choke as
the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)
but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings.
I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for
the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose
me... What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a full
schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? I'd
love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such
low volume :-)
Most commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage;
that's handled by the big caps on the primary side, those which in a
linearly-regulated power supply would be considered the ""filter"" caps,
coming right after the bridge.  The transformer is just that - a
transformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although
the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT
negligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to
get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a
""snubber"" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended
for switcher use today have the diode built in.)
The basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in
a somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a
high voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or
""filter"") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.
The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,
resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which
are then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs
is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,
which acts in a ""pulse-width modulation"" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying
the pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and
therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs
may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less
tracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear
regulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the
regulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)
is not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various
safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be
electrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator
to meet this requirement.
While the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these
designs, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can
be ignored; besides the inductive ""kick"" giving the switch transistor a
bad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the
energy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.
In some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,
you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't
saturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the
imagination! :-)).
I'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer;
hopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors
in the above.

I'm not sure about this.  If the ground connections on the outlets are

I really don't know where to post this question so I figured that
this board would be most appropriate.
I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that
are ever present at nuclear poer sites. They look like cylinders
that have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what the
actual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they're called
'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?
Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants
are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling
towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for
coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.
Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when
its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network
of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling
and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the
hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than
just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is
rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently
seen rising out of these towers.
That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because
it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of
the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.
The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam
system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the
boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across
the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and
by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it
back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference
(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage ""hot""
turbine to final stage ""cold"" turbine).

Great Explaination, however you left off one detail, why do you always
see them at nuclear plants, but not always at fossil fuel plants.  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many
fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination.

"telephone systems have the capability of a passband of 30hz to 4Khz.
The reason they do not implement this is: It is not backward compatable
to every telephone system.  In addition, the most effecent mix of
electrical effecency, and intelegability closly mateches a 300hz-3khz
passband.
Close, but no banana (to paraphrase Garfield)...
The reason 300-3300 Hz is used is that voice channels used to occupy
4kHz bands when multiplexed on a trunk line. Therefore, 300Hz at the
bottom, and 700Hz at the top of this band were filtered to minimise
interference with the next band.
Nowadays, digital trunks have made this less relevant, but the phone
companies still see no reason to improve quality (especially for free!).
Therefore, digital ""chunk of a trunk"" segments still have a guaranteed
bandwidth of only 4kHz (so they can carry the equivalent of one analog
line) at the clock rate of a standard PCM T1 or E1 digital trunk.
It's all historical...
Here in the UK, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to
local lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. Private
lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are
usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital.
Don't quote me on that..... But I think I remember a BT engineer

"Hello net.  I have a 386sx motherboard with the Phoenix BIOS, an on-board
IDE controller port, and two on-board serial ports.  Unfortunately, I don't
have a manual for this beast and I would like to be able to disable the IDE
controller in order to use the MFM controller I have.
The board says it is made in Korea and it uses the Chips Chipset.  If
anyone can give me a clue as to how to go about configuring the board so as
not to use the IDE controller, or how to go about finding out how to do it,
their help would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you in advance for your assistance.
Please mail buhrow@nfbcal.org with your responses as my news feed is rather
tenuous.
Thank you very much!

"I think there is a huge difference in the materials and
process for printer/toner PCB's. I get first time, everytime
results from a local HP Postscript, and hardly ever works from
copies of the same artwork. The printer results are so good
that I have quit even looking for PC board processes. If I had
to use the copier version, I would think I would look elsewhere.
The moral? Experiment and find what works. Toner transfer CAN
give excellent results. It, like any process, gives erratic
results with variable inputs.

From what I have read about these little gadgets, it works on
a electrochemical galvanic principle. The sensing unit has a
chemical matrix which produces an electrical voltage proportional
to the amount of chemical compound it is designed for ... in this case
I believe it is the Hydroxyl group???
I have also heard -  not tested :-)  - since common gasoline is also
a member of this Hydroxyl group, it will also cause a failing breathalizer

Hello
I'm considering modernizing some old wiring in my home, and
I need a little advice on outlet wiring.  Several outlets
are the old 'two prong' type, without the ground.  Naturally,
the wire feeding these outlets is 12/2, WITHOUT the ground
wire.  I noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the
12/2 with ground, and that on these circuits, the ground
wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral (white) wire.
SO..  Here's my question.  It seems to me that I'd have the
same electrical circuit if I hooked the neutral[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[Da jumper from the neutral
over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding outlets.
What's wrong with my reasoning here?
First, it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection.
Secondly, The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire
shouldn't be, or only during a fault condition.
The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the
tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the
grounded center-tap the neutral.  This gives 120v to neutral(ground) from
each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.  So in effect
the neutral and ground should be at the same potential.

"Hi,
Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under
my belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp. So,
I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!
Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No,
Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:
Ai [Current Gain]
Av [Voltage Gain]
Ap [Power Gain]
or whatever.
I already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, but
I would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the parts
list has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin?
SIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 mag
so it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement in
the latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I could
figure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas?
I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp
models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for High
power amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than
I started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet
good gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this
E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me?
I'm open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help!
Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News...
And I'll post if there's and interest!

Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits
wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M
bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to
perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,
which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I
believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).

So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT
HDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense.
Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk
sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to
memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is
quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the
controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached,
the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and
it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more
loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.
The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU
for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really
does stink.

point of view, why does SCSI have an advantage when it comes to multi-
tasking?  Data is data, and it could be anywhere on the drive.  Can
SCSI find it faster?  can it get it off the drive and into the computer
faster?  Does it have a better cache system?  I thought SCSI was good at
managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached.  If we are
only talking about a single drive, explain why SCSI is inherently
faster at managing data from a hard drive.
IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics
currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized
drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.
Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first?
You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they
exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?
Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone
know how they perform?
So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES
the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode
it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.
As implimented on what system?
The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
SCSI-2 through put.
Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive
controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do
at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?
What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?
The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling
prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which
in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its
cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the
Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt
the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}
The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card
(or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down
in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc
or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions
of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to
come down in price.
I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented
data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when
managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.

Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be

Have fun trying to get hold of technical support over the phone.  At least

How long does he have to take in fixing it?  Does he have to use new

Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a

contain files from other machines are unreadable. Also, 3.5 floppies
that were written by this defective floppy drive a long time ago are
also unreadable.
This sounds like a head alignment problem. How does one go about
fixing it? Are there alignment screws that you can adjust?
Thanks in advance for your responses.

A friend of mine had the same problem, it turned out that his floppy was
set up as a 5 1/4 1.2Mb drive instead of 3.5 1.44Mb.....

I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re:
performance. Where do they get those numbers? I'll list the actual
performance ranges, which should convince anyone that such a
statement is absurd:
SCSI-I ranges from 0-5MB/s.
SCSI-II ranges from 0-40MB/s.
IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.
ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)
By your OWN data the ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI"" is correct
(How is 0-40 twice 1.25? Do you just pick whatever SCSI setup that makes
the statment ""correct""?)
Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that ESDI and IDE (I include SCSI and ATA) are
completely different (ESDI is device-level, like MFM/RLL).
With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed
""20% faster than IDE"" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been
Great, you can compare two numbers (ATA has several speed modes, by the
way) but what the article said was misleading/wrong.

mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}
I would recommend people call the NCR board and download the ANSI specs
if they are really interested in this stuff.
Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI
is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip
an Apple salesperson said ""it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip"" {Not at a 6MB/s,
10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra
uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see
Something is missing there. :) Anyway, I agree. There's a lot of
opportunity for marketing jingo like ""SCSI-2 compliant"" which tells
you nothing about the performance, whether it has ""WIDE"" support, etc.
One reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is
(Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)).
What does it use? Hopefully a good NCR chip (e.g. 53c710)

"Hi
I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3
86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my
second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix
from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the
ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from
them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say ""Buy the memory
from us"" or something like that.)
The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a
1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or
enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB
of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.
Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I
asked them why, and all I got was ""Your point is well taken, but
Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.""
So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805
drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to
get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my
system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're
broken.
If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805
cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are ""less
busy"".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805
product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),
although evenn that might be a misprint.
Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out
there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I
coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.
Thanks.

In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses).

It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is.
I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around.
My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it, so I
consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things:
- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2
Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example)
- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it
support (text & graphics)
- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM
- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000
- Support in software
If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like
to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell
me about it.
For the people in Holland:

There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you
more CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap.
With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to ""think"" while disk
operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly
waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take
an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.
So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.
One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it
possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move
the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface
created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data
bytes, with no DMA.

million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets
close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few

Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI-1 for hard drives YES the ""figure includes a
hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers""  This is sloppy people and DUMB.
But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you
get more performance for the money.
Ok once again with the SCSI spec list:
SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s
asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s.
SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}
Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1
so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.
SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst
{for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit
hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1
devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds}
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.
Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower
{Range 0-5MB/s}
ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)
One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by
people.  Its PROPER meaning is ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of

PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,

{this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2}
To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:
{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}
""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the
speed of IDE...""
or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}
""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...""
NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.
SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers
are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed

"First of all:  Thank you everyone who replied.  As you can well
imagine, I got nearly one hundred responses, so I figured I'd thank
you all here instead of individually.
The tallies:
I got one vote for A/UX, which runs on the Macintosh.
I got several nays for Commodore's 3000UX system.
Most people agreed that SGI's were nice, and very very expensive.
Some (devoted) Sun users nearly insisted that I try to find a used
Sun, say a 3/60 or 3/80.
About a dozen people told me how they love their NeXT...only now NeXT
is out of the hardware business (see below).
And most of the other 85+ people said:  Get a 486 box, and run some
version of Unix that's available either in the Public Domain or
commercially.
And so I weighed my options.  What stood out, in my opinion, was that
there were several different versions of Unix available on one system:
the 486 (PC) architecture.  If I bought a Sun, I'd have to use SunOS.
If I bought a (used) NeXT, I'd have to use NeXTSTEP (see below).  Ad
nauseum.
But with a PC, I can run Linux, which is a small user-friendly (?)
flavor that uses shared libraries to cut down on volume, although I
hear its networking abilities aren't up to speed with 386bsd, another
PD (==free) port (which takes up a lot more space).  I can purchase
BSD386 (commercial product) if I choose.  There are several other
commercial packages available.
So, what I've found out (after pricing systems, etc.), is that I can
get a really good Unix workstation for as little as ~$2500.  Including
source code!
Or, for ~$3500-4000, I can get an unbelievable EISA bus 486-66DX2
system, fully blown, and run single user BSD386.
What I'm really excited about, though, is NEXTSTEP for Intel.  NeXT
changed into a software company only, and they are releasing their OS
for PC's.  I've used NeXT's before, and I absolutely loved them.
Everyone who wrote me about NeXT (or NEXTSTEP) commented on the
developer's environment, and how well designed the whole package is.
So, my choice is to:
1)  Wait for the mail on Monday, so I can read what NEXTSTEP's system
requirements are
2)  If I'm wowed on what they say, I'll buy a system that fits into
their criteria
2a)  Get NEXTSTEP
3)  If I'm wowed, but I can't afford it yet (most likely), I'll buy a
system that fits their criteria
3a)  Get Linux or 386bsd, as a temporary learning experience so I
can save up for NEXTSTEP
4)  If I'm not sufficiently wowed (least likely), I'll buy a system
that is slightly less blown out (like a 486DX 25, ISA) and put Linux
or 386bsd on it.
Again, thanks to everyone around the net.

1) What is a 16550 UART?
I don't know the exact meaning of UART, but I think it is something like
Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter. Normally, the older boards have
a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char
they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the
right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.
2) What does it do for high-speed modems?
3) Is it necessary for 14.4k or higher throughput?
If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a

running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the
cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.
The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.
4) Is it only for internal modems?
NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board,
whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port
which has the UART on board.
If you have any experience with 9600 or higher speed modems, please
let me know what you think.  Also, any particular brand name reccomended,
or will a cheapo clone do just a well?
I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied
with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.

What's the difference between loading mouse.com in autoexec.bat and
doing device=mouse.sys in config.sys??
The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be
loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com
will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.
which one is better?
mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it
could - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it.
The working of both drivers is totally the same.
When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat,
because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the
ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone,
because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.

I have a question concerning SCSI on DOS.
I have a ST01 SCSI controller and two hard-disks conected
(id's 0 and 1). I'd like to connect a SCSI streamer, but I
don't have software to access it. Does such a beast exist
as shareware or PD ?
Also what if I want a third disk ? I know that DOs only can
""see"" two two physical and four logical disks. Will it be
possible to use extra disks ?
Contrary to what others might have thought, I actually did have a SCSI drive
once.  It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller.  I found that the
controller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave, so the best I could do
with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec.
I have had that drive/controller coexist with MFM, RLL, and IDE drives
because the ST-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help
needed from the computer's bios.  Dos will see many logical drives, much more
than 4 (I've had up to 10).  I've often wondered how many SCSI drives you
could hang off a ST-01/02.

"I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option
of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The
existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,
but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave
relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.
The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually
going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0
The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991
They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).
There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are
for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine
had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.
When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does
flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.
Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I
would not even know how to do that.
Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number
for Western Digital might just do as good!

This is normally the case, but make sure you get a board with a plug in oscillator

"Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully.
Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want
to trade elsewhere.
Despite the fact that they answer the phone, ""Hi! I'm <whoever and we're
having a GREAT Day!"", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return
a modem that didn't work as I expected it to.
The details:
I ordered one of their house brand ""Infotel"" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.
In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over
the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not
have ordered it, had I known this in advance.
It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was
preconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.
For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the
time I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.
Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or
14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After
spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested
disabling the COM2 port.
This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long
term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both
would not be in use at the same time as the modem.
I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail
hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I
was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they
didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.
I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA
number. She promptly switched me to a ""Tech Support"" rep that implied that
it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA
number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I
was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.
Conclusion:
I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does
not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more
than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local
charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered
a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.
For $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know
will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal
experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have
known better...

we are talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller.
Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section:
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card
expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous}
SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these
modes is mainly in the software drivers.
Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal
terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port
{A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end.
Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.
SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for
a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.
SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.
8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using
SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which
results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit
and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software
drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI
interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term
'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},
8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
{32-bit}.
8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2
that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software
controlers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds
for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT
NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit
SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1
electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider
16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but
4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1
but is 8-bit SCSI-2.
Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.
8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost
compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.

"I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU
cooler on the chip.  After about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough
to dislodge the CPU from its mount.  It ended up bending a few pins
on the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet.  I ended up
pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU
cooler back on.  So far so good.
Have others had this problem?  How do you ensure that the weight of
the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its
socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?

"I have a 486sx25 computer with a 105 Mg Seagate IDE drive and a controler
built into the motherboard. I want to add a SCSI drive (a quantum prodrive
425F 425 MG formatted). I have no documentation at all and I need your
help!
As I understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive.  Could you
please tell me if I'm right..
1- Buy a SCSI contoler.  Which one? I know Adaptec is good, but they are
kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want
it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on
the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the
adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the
quantum?
2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable.
Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and
all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.
3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type
of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive.
4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I
think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with
SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual
(clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want
the drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this?
Well that seems to be all. Is there anythiing I'm forgetting?

However since the ISA bus has only 24 bits,
then anything on the bus can access only 16Mb

So far I agree with the arguments.
Then the writer claims that glitches can
occur in systems with over 16Mb because
of that limit. That part I don't understand
because the RAM is right on the motherboard.
So the cpu should have no problems talking
with the RAM. Can anybody explain this ?
The problem is with ISA bus-masters which
can only address the first 16MBs of system
memory.  Bus-masters do not use the CPU
nor the system DMA to do the actual data
transfer but transfer their data directly
to the system RAM.

The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 &

"Hi Netters!
I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about
my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:
1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).
The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both
systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup /
restore program.  Both systems have 3.5"" and 5.25"" floppies.
2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).
From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible
solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these
options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees
any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking
(I don't know very much about these beasts):
1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.
Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?
What do the floppies themselves cost?
2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a
few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any
happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?
3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
(maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)
4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or
recommendations for manufacturers?
I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will
summarize all responses for the net.

"Hi all,

"I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...
Some background about my PC:
- American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM
- config.sys file:
device=c:\dos\himem.sys
dos=high,umb
device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems
files=30
buffers=30
stack=9,256
- autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c
- CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.
The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31
I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL.
Run excel, no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place
for windows.
Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop
for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also
allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:).
The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)
from the desktop.
First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages. The
following are some of them:
- Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some
number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture)
- General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address
- Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address
Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address
0001:XXXX means?
I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the
TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.
Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.
Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try
anything.

micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton
6.xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results.  I was
told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide

I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem

know if I could tell the difference.
I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS (bus speed at the like)

IDE drives have jumpers on them to indicate if it is a master or a slave.
If it is a master, then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present.
These must be set correctly according to each drive's manufacturers spec-
ification.  The CMOS setup is almost positively NOT the problem.  It is
probably not the controller - IDE controllers all support exactly two
drives maximum.  Check those jumpers.

If you don't get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate
yourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing
you into medicine; your academic and extracurricular
accomplishments.  Make a decision about whether you *really*
want to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out
in the first semester of med school because they found it was
not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four
years in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a
career is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be
pushed into it because of your parents/family/significant
other.
If you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you
can improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from
a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive
recommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous
professor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don't
be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest
and positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no,
sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  I
have turned down writing recommendations for some students
because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful
comments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them
at that point.
Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an English
professor or some other friendly person with skill and
experience in writing and proof-reading and get their
criticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you
say it.
Review your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor
in some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further
coursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help
here.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut
courses, it usually shows.
Look at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in
local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus;
substantial leadership roles in an organization help also.
Beware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to
spot and weed out.
Overall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why
you want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal

Speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center, the above
behavior is completely inappropriate. If a patient who requires extensive
care shows up at the last minute, we always see them and give them appropriate
care. It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its

Thanks,

EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove
calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such
use).  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung
disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side
-effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also
binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when
EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that
were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove
calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C
and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra
vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium
from the plaques).
The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably
can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns
with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.
1. ""Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review""
Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with
magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels.
2. ""The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular
disease"" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the
serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be
overemphasized.  This is a review article.
3. ""Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis
in cholesterol-fed rabbits"" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990).
Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of
plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol
added to their normal food.
Since EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for
the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.

MSG is mono sodium glutamate, a fairly straight forward compound. If it is

impurities may be the cause.
My experience of MSG effects (as part of a double blind study) was that the
pure stuff caused me some rather severe effects.
I was under the (possibly incorrect) assumption that most of the MSG on

there other sources of MSG?
Soya bean, fermented cheeses, mushrooms all contain MSG.
I am one of those folx who react, sometimes strongly, to MSG. However,
I also react strongly to sodium chloride (table salt) in excess. Each
causes different symptoms except for the common one of rapid heartbeat

The symptoms I had were numbness of jaw muscles in the first instance
followed by the arms then the legs, headache, lethargy and unable to keep

In myopia the cornea is too curved.  There is too much of a bulge in the

In PRK the laser removes a small amount of material from the center.
In RK the surgeon cuts incisions near the edge.  They heal, and the scarring

Your doctor is right. It is best to do nothing, besides taking some pain
medication initially. Some patients don't like this and expect, or demand,
to have something done. In these cases some physicians will ""tape"" the
patient (put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest), or prescribe
an elastic binder. All this does is make it harder to breath, but the
patient doesn't feel cheated, because soemthing is being done about the
problem. Either way, the end results are the same.

"I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to
be carcinogenic that ""it would not be legal in the U.S."".  I think that
naturally occuring substances (excluding ""controlled"" substances) are
pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additives
or other ""consumption"".  It's only when the chemists concoct (sp?) an
ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations.  Otherwise, if they
really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything.
How in the world do you suppose it's legal to ""consume"" tobacco products
(which probably SHOULD be banned)?
No, there is something called the ""Delany Amendment"" which makes carcinogenic
food additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the
1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased
detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.
This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very
weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are
banned.
This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a
time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good,
and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned.
This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.
If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone
would do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates
that enforcement is still in effect.
An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as ""gumbo file'"".
This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  This
is not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its natural
form, so maybe that's how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemption
was made, to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats.

Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis,
but rarely proves anything in a positive sense.  And unlike
mathematics, boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical
issues, and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually
disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease.
So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,
controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any
better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject
disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling
back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
convincing evidence either positive or negative.
I would characterize it not as 'abject disbelief' but rather
'scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions'.
it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind
study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out

Well, if that's the case in YOUR practice, I have a hard time
figuring out how you even managed to make it into the bottom half
of your class, or did you create your diplomas with crayons?
If someone runs a medical practice with only a 10% success rate,
they either tackle problems for which they are not qualified to
treat, or they have no conscience and are only in business for
fraudulent purposes.
OTOH, who are we kidding, the New England Medical Journal in 1984
ran the heading: ""Ninety Percent of Diseases are not Treatable by
Drugs or Surgery,"" which has been echoed by several other reports.
No wonder MDs are not amused with alternative medicine, since
the 20% magic of the ""placebo effect"" would award alternative
practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine...

While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious
that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was
at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance
of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that
something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation
into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).  ...
Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or
dreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or
sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of
intense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam
freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming
up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis
of the problem first.
Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something
that one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned,
but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the
key elements in developing it.
Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new
scientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic
studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the
theory of evolution.
This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes
empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal
exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation
does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical
studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very
poor kind of science.

While methodology cannot be subject to the same kind of ""experimental

appraised.  Methodologies can be compared to each other, sometimes by
the conflicting results they produce.  This kind of critical appraisal
and comparison, together with the inappropriateness of existing
methodologies for new fields of study, is what drives the evolution of
methodologies and how we think about them.
As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not
willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which
is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest
purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.
This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management
is accurate bookkeeping.
If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it
would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What
was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the
methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?
In an earlier article, Russell Turpin writes:
None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should
open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo-science.
Modern advocates of homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional
Chinese medicine receive little respect because, for the most
part, they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research
Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty.  (This does
*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does*
imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are
incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and
which are not.)
First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I
don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,
homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be
accepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of
homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.
What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things
(including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific
attention.
If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not
use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is
effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all
of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose
methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.
It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine
those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is
also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on
those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous
fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.
But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is
capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no
ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly
be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as
doctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in

I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think it's warranted.
HSP's are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they
are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated
using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY
protein- because it's DEAD!
Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be
completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.

Do you believe that any quacks exist?  How about quack diagnoses?  Is

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of
the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting
any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though ""accepted"", may
not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick

traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients
that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.
Now to make a general comment on many recent posts:
Lately I've seen the word ""quack"" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or
doctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical
subject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say ""quack-quack"" and
somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over
on their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach
you in medical school - how to throw your authority around?
Let me put it another way to make my point clear:  ""quack"" is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.
The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming
from any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real
scary.
But what do I know, I've already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this

The funny thing is the personaly stories about reactions to MSG vary so
greatly. Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some
claim their heart ""skipped"" beats once in a while.
Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed
face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular
pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in
the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are
sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else,
one can get too much of a good thing.
Some reacted with headache,
Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased
heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries,
essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency
her, necessarily.
some stomach ache.
Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not
necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting
occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has
eaten. If a person can't digest the stuff (entirely possible - the
list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an
enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly
ache) would be expected.
Some had watery eyes or running nose,
These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar
to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious
compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible
some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the
symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets
can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be
necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person
was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration
and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from
simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.
some
had itchy skin or rashes.
People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends
upon what it is about the compound that ""pisses off"" their body.
Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many
people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an
histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,
causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an
allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that
contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can
perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.
More serious accusations include respiration
difficulty
See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory
problems are not serious. They can be deadly.
and brain damage.
The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system
controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling
the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,
and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.
Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food
poisoning.
Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,
say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus
too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,
plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days
before from drinking out of the same glass. Could be all sorts of
things.
But it might be the MSG.
if you heard things about MSG, you may think it must be it.
If noone else got sick, its likely not food poisoning. Probably
stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy's allergic to.
Anyway, the human body's not a machine; people vary widely in their
responses, and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things.

"Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added to
restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts
to feel ""puffy"", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my
mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.
The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants
(usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food
chain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese
fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of
what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.
I am under the impression that MSG ""enhances"" flavor by causing the
taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable
to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.
Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)
involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is
what I suspect as being the cause.
I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals
showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab
rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.
Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are
totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied
they know of.  I will probably respond to them however with a reminder
of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the
tobacco companies still deny).

DN consultation is cheaper than a scan.
And also better, because a neurologist can make a differential

headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.  A neurologist
can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the

Sigh.  It may never be justifiable, but I sometimes do it.  Even
after I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic
examination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis,
salted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask ""why can't you
order a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?""  Aunt Millie often gets

what your magic is.
Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.
Mind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,
but the patient feels like ""something is being done"" (as if the
hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were
""nothing""), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper

I've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
demented during hospital stays. In the examples I've seen, drugs were
definitely involved.
My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
hospital. He was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate
drugs...
No wonder he became confused!  With so many drugs, it is almost impossible
to know which one is causing the problem.  And because some drugs
potentiate the effect of each other, they can make the side effects
all the worse, and even dangerous.  (kinda like mixing alcohol and
antihistamines!)
...he was disoriened [the doctors thougt ] they should put him on something
else as well!
Unfortunately, doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of
the drugs a patient is receiving.  If one drug they are taking causes
the patient's blood pressure to go up, many times an antihypertensive
is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug.
This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs
at home!!!!
....procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss
it with an independent doc. Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL
at all. HALDOL may have been used validly, or it may have been
prescribed because OTHER medication confused her, and because the
hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly.
I fully agree.  In addition, she proably should be examined by another
doctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking.
I can't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during
a lecture, but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have
the need for the drug re-evaluated regularly.  If her current physician
is unwilling to do this, find one who will.  Either check the phone
book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology,
or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society.
By finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tune
with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help.

there is no ingredient but water left.  Chiropractic: all illness
stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such

Sure there are quacks. There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who
treat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly.
There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones.
There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories
and rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists.
Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who.
Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors
quacks in Babylon.
Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses
aren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue
against the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month
or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an
opinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody.
Sometimes a correct diagnosis
takes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the
disease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they have
something that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't been
described yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out,
sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment,
sometimes they find it's incurable.
There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an
illness. Unless it's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it's is
more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking.

acne problem for many years.  I then found that if I vigorously scrub my face
with a nail brush and soap (Irish Spring) twice a day the acne was not a

"As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous
question ""WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?"" I must assume
that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.
She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it
and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she
believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.
(Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the
idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the
food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG
be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit
forming) ?
This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my
children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet
food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other
brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some
sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are:
Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet
food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in
pet food?

Keith is the only person I have ever heard of that keeps the weight
off without any conscious effort to control eating behavior.  ... most
of us have to diet a lot to keep from going back to morbid obesity.
I attribute my success to several factors:
Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,
I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I
estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.
Very little sugar or salt.
Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are
recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard
of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can
contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as
likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are
just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)
My ""clean your plate"" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last
10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch
up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.
I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry
shortly, and eating won't be practical then).
I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to
stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.
I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps
build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes
runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my
metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable
with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if
it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess
ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that
weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim
weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)
There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically
different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,
it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.
Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've
done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who
did try it and didn't succeed.
I think all of us cycle.  One's success depends on how large the
fluctuations in the cycle are.  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.
I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.
I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,
my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes
off again over a week or two.

One possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves, while root

There is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from

I think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to

Well, the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make

"Summary of thread:
A person has Crohns, raw vegetables cause problems (unspecified)
Steve Holland replies:  patient may have mild obstruction.  Avoid things
that would plug her up.  Crohn's has no dietary restriction in general.
In article <1993Apr22.210631.13300@aio.jsc.nasa.gov,
spenser@fudd.jsc.nasa.gov (S. Spenser Aden) wrote:
Interesting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  I'm
certainly not questioning Steve's claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I
agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammation
can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.
The feeling obout this has changed in the GI community.  The current
feeling
is that inflammation is not induced by food.  There is even evidence that
patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation
of
intestinal growth factors.  There is now interest in providing small
amounts
of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition.  But I digress.
Symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.
Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough
caveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically,
the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be
realized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds
of inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.
Therefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common
inflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's,
of the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:
Completely out - never again - items:
o corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-)
o popcorn (same)
o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins
o nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)
The low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions.
Again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  These foods are
avoided because they may get stuck.  I'd go ahead and have the
fudge, though ;-)  .
Discouraged greatly:
o raw vegetables (too fibrous)
o wheat and raw grain breads
o exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water)
o greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)
o little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!)
o long grain and wild rice (husky)
o beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!)
o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing
I was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this
day and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your
system as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the
NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try
the ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad, don't do it again!
Remember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the
daylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more
thoroughly - you're mileage may vary.
As with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.  But
this is the info I've been given, and it may be a starting point for
discussion.  Good luck!
Spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and
informed patient.  Would that many patients be able to tell what
causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but
if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are
tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohn's
commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with
severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.
There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed
the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading
to anyone with an interest in Crohn's.
And, as I always say when dealing with Crohn's, as does Spencer, Good Luck!

All your friend really has to do is find a Registered Dietician(RD).  While
most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's who
are in ""private practice"" so to speak.  Many physicans will refer their
patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can get
your friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for
the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The
better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's
plan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to
control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal.
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and
lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but
I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For
bad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects
are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developing
a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with
inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet.

:) No...I was one of the lucky ones. Very little acne as a teenager. I
didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it
really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.
Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp
thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under
the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day
vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it
is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be
where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease
on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating
meat).
Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm
water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will
help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it
softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with
oilyness.
Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with
a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any
prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of
pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't
be an infection afterwards.
Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry

incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).

Gordon, your experience is valid for many, but not all.  The
fact that you know a few people who have been overweight and are
now stable at a lower (normal or just less?) weight does not
contradict the observation that only 5-10 per cent can maintain
ideal weight with current technology.
Actually, the observation is that only 5-10% of those who seek help
from your so-called ""diet evangelists"" can maintain their weight.  I
happen to agree with Keith Lynch that there are many people who can
and do lose weight on their own, and who are not reflected in the
dismal failure rate that is often quoted.
Wasn't there a study where a researcher asked a more general population,
perhaps some part of a university community, about weight loss and he/she
found that a much higher percentage had lost and maintained?
In fact Adiposity 101 mentions a similar study (search for ""life
events"" in any recent version of Adiposity 101).
The problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have
lost weight and kept it off is that we don't know what caused
the weight gain in the first place.  This is critical because
someone who gains weight because of something temporary (drug
effect, life event, etc.) may appear successful at dieting when
the weight loss was really the result of reversing the temporary
condition that caused the weight gain.

Subject: Discussions on alt.psychoactives

Could the people discussing recreational drugs such as mj, lsd, mdma, etc.,
take their discussions to alt.drugs? Their discussions will receive greatest
contribution and readership there. The people interested in strictly
""smart drugs"" (i.e. Nootropics) should post to this group. The two groups
(alt.drugs & alt.psychoactives) have been used interchangably lately.
I do think that alt.psychoactives is a deceiving name. alt.psychoactives
is supposedly the ""smart drug"" newsgroup according to newsgroup lists on
the Usenet. Should we establish an alt.nootropics or alt.sdn (smart drugs &
nutrients)? I have noticed some posts in sci.med.nutrition regarding
""smart nutrients."" We may lower that groups burden as well.
I beg to disagree with you on this subject.  If I recall correctly,
alt.drugs was being flodded by posts like ""how do I grow MJ"" ""How do I
use a bong?"" ""wow, man, I just had the coolest trip"" etc...  There were
quite a few people out there who were versed in pharmacology and biology
who wanted to discuss centrally active substabces at a higher level
without all the other crap filling the bandwidth.    I would suggest
that you proceed to create a newsgroup dedicated to Nootropics if you
must have one dedicated to them, and leave alt.psychoactives to the
discussion of psychoactives (including nootropics, which are but a small
portion of the realm of centrally active substances).
I was wondering if a group called 'sci.pharmacology' would be relevent.
This would be used for a more formal discussion about pharmacological
issues (pharmacodynamics, neuropharmacology, etc.)
Just an informal proposal (I don't know anything about the net.politics
for adding a newsgroup, etc.)

amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40
years.
The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil

groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's
fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a
reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with
police agencies and journalists.
There is something almost comical in the fact that Yigal Arens is
important enough to have the ADL and G-d knows who else sifting through his
garbage (which happens to be legal; you throw it out, it ain't yours any more).
This brings to mind a few possibilities other than the ADL connection:
- it is all in Arens' mind.
- Bullock may have been working for Arens' friend in the PLO
- Arens' father (or is it brother?) Moshe Arens (former Israeli Defense
Minister) was spying on him.
- Arens hired Bullock to spy on him to get attention.
In any case, who cares?

A unconventional proposal for peace in the Middle-East.
Elias Davidsson
Of all the stupid postings you've brought here recently, it is
illuminating that you chose to put your own name on perhaps the
stupidest of them.
The following proposal is based on the following assumptions:
1.      Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to
education, to establish a family and have children, to human
dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are
more important to human existence that the rights of states.
Does this mean that you are calling for the dismantling of the Arab
states?
2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and
rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.
Apparently, your answer is yes.
6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional
political means have failed.
Attempts to solve these problem by traditional military means and
non-traditional terrorist means has also failed.  But that won't stop
them from trying again.  After all, it IS a Holy War, you know....
7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two
distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the
land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.
""No just solution possible.""  How very encouraging.
Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.
You mean that it gets even funnier?
1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants
for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew
and the other Palestinian-Arab.
3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For
the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each
subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.
4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which
have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the
Israeli-Arab conflict,
No, the Fund should be financed by the Center for Policy Research.  It
IS a major organization, isn't it?  Isn't it?
5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'
marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on
'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its
ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a
truly civil society.
Yeah, just like marriages among Arabs has strengthened their
societies.
The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of
people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the
Middle-East in a graceful manner.
The world could do with a bit less Middle Eastern ""grace"".
Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will
attempt to identify some of these:

Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip
during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the
Jewish state, Palestinian sources said on Sunday.
The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of
the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for
Palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and
occupied West Bank.
Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked
soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled,
the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.
On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their
pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents
are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.
The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth
escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur
Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them
against a wall, and put their arms around them.
When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat
him with the butts of their rifles.
On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising
Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the
soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the
beating.
On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded
him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As
the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued
dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.
The army said it was checking the reports.
Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday
to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.
Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in
prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after
soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.
``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father
George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.
Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of
Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.
Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation
of requesting permits to reach holy sites.
Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement
to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian
celebrations.
``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption.
But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.
An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his
identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.

Today's AL HAMISHMAR quotes Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
Independence Day interview yesterday on Israel Television. Rabin
said that enforcing Jewish sovereignty over the entire Land of
Israel would lead to the establishment of a bi-national state. ""I
would view it as if the historical destiny of my generation, Dor
Tashach, the generation that had the great privilege of determining
the fate of the people and founding the Jewish state, had been
lost.""  Rabin added, ""We must stop dreaming of settlements [i.e. in
the Territories] and focus on qualitative and substantive changes
in Israeli society to make it a productive society dependent on its
own labor."" The Prime Minister concluded saying that he would like
to achieve a significant breakthrough in the peace process during
his government's term.

(an act that is illegal in Jordan), but when it happened, it was just
business.
The Arabs that lived along the coast in Western Palestine, later to be
called Israel, were shafted by their brother Arabs just as they've
been shafted for decades since then by their Arab bretheren.  Somehow,
though, the Arab call has continued to blame Israel, not only for the
Syrian landowner sell-out in Western Palestine (Israel) but even for
the occupation of Eastern Palestine (Jordan) by the Hashemites.  This
is just more of refusing to take blame for one's own actions.

This is not small. A 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies
a doubling in 69/2.7 \approx 25 years. Can you imagine that? Most people
seem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists,
for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates,
but large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things
like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation,
and water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's

the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards

More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have
been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims
that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.
Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley
and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's
massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.
From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of
Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters
of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their
own lines.
We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last
troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out.
They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov,
who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert
to ease their departure.
A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their
dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the
same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian
positions.
In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another
31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures
do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed
the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also
do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies
Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200
people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came
by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and
of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies
we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents.
The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which
killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre.
All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly
clothing of workers.
Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national
volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians,
including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS,

Just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  As far as
I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement
between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel
revise this preliminary draft as necessary:
1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform
or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female
Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but
young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of
Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further
provocation is required.
2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant
Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans
without positive identification as military personnel, clear
indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.
a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for
Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively
military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or
self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note
that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,
AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive
military identification and require closer inspection such
as document checks.
b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,
which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less
than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals
of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a
single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,
as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.
As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to
originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify
armed response.
c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive
military identification of all personnel in the target area of
the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not
be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft
are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the
papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously
civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of
uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov
coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to
land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should
first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.
For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters
is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated
if necessary.

First of all, the arab standing in any party, or as any party, is solely
dependent upon the amount of political power they can wield effectively.
It is not a question of an individuals standing. When a party puts up an
Arab for a Cabinet post and that Arab is rejected but the position is given
to a Jew from the same party we are not talking about power but racism.
Would you care to deny this has happened on several occasions with Labour
coalitions?
In the past, they have not been effective at garnering votes and forming
a single bloc in the knesset.  On the few occasions when this was done,
some of the parties took stands that were extremist, and ineffect precluded
themselves from forming a coalition and participating in the cabinet.
Not their party - them as *individuals*. Even when they belong to nice
peaceful Zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome. Arabs are
excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse. It

Arabs are excluded from cabinet, even when they do the things you

The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92
By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday
The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be
little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian
fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week.
Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the
Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of
how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25
February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the
surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in
one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were
shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I
also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift
hospital in a string of railway carriages.
Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by
Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov
Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to
his  town.   "" So where are the rest?"".  Some might have  taken
prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the
mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to
retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of
cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees.
One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at
first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting
to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict.
But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored
personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend
themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the
forests. In the small hours, the massacre started.
Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken
prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that
troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack
Khojaly. ""It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes.""

"Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of
2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet
Armenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion
of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical
documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs,
was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors,
program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and
radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide
of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people
of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the
lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is
mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their
lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations
may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and
prosperously.
------------------------- letter ----------------------------------
During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government
has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which
not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the
method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day,
Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order
to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland,
which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia
continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:
1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.
2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism
Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish
Genocide.
3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through
the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.
4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters
of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.
Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.
Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its
terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks
to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically
exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on
this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of
governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition
of the Turkish Genocide.
With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial
demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people
will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims
of the Turkish Genocide demand:
1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian
Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;
2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people;
3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;
4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially
recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;
5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it
has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially
recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be
supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;
6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact
of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of
2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.
The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first
genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new
generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically
mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through
all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the
armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon
all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in
the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary
of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

"It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.I recieved a couple of letters too,some has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.Those who contest this statement present the figures of the World War II.However we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop it,today is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILL.It
seems to be that what we lack is the will.
Second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community
didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event,
today inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which
is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possibly
unintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.And this,I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.

On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians,
we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an
emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.
In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed
de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a
genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively
ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The
result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen
and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization
on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any
vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish
governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture
distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In
the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies
shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy
merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state
policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a
crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the
successful genocide of the Armenians.
Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...
Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of
Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as
""rebels"".
Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population
figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.
Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims
Armenians were a ""threat"".
In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of
approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.
Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The
success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish
population.
The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and
property lost as a result of this genocide.

Well, Panos, Mr. Tamamidis?, the way you put it it is only the Turks
who bear the responsibility of the things happening today. That is hard to
believe for somebody trying to be objective.
When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
blame one side only, there always are bad guys on both sides.
What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway?
Do you think it was your right to be there?
There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor until 1923.
Someone had to protect them. If not us who??
I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering.
It is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise.
I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better.
Compromise on what, the invasion of Cyprus, the involment of Turkey in
Greek politics, the refusal of Turkey to accept 12 miles of territorial
waters as stated by international law, the properties of the Greeks of
Konstantinople, the ownership of the islands in the Greek lake,sorry, Aegean.
There are some things on which there can not be a compromise.
The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
people. They have never met me but they know! I am bad person
because I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business, and it is
not the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individuals
why the hatred?
Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or
indirecly is a ""bad"" person.
It is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support of the
actions of your goverment that make you ""bad"".
People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you
are. You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and
as a such you must pay the price.
So that makes me think that there is some kind of
brainwashing going on in Greece. After all why would an educated person
treat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about your
history books and things you learn about Greek-Turkish
encounters during your schooling.

You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks. Just talk to

You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about them from

More Money Allocated to Building Infrastructure in Territories to
Create Jobs for Palestinians
KOL YISRAEL reports that public works geared at building
infrastructure costing 140 million New Israeli Shekels (about 50
million dollars) will begin Sunday in the Territories. This was
announced last night by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Finance
Minister Avraham Shohat in an effort to create more jobs for
Palestinian residents of the Territories. This infusion of money
will bring allocations given to developing infrastructure in the
Territories this year to 450 million NIS, up from last year's
figure of 120 million NIS.
While I applaud investing of money in Yehuda, Shomron, v'Chevel-Azza,
in order to create jobs for their residents, I find it deplorable that
this has never been an active policy of any Israeli administration
since 1967, *with regard to their Jewish residents*. Past governments
found funds to subsidize cheap (read: affordable) housing and the
requisite infrastructure, but where was the investment for creating
industry (which would have generated income *and* jobs)?
After 26 years, Yehuda and Shomron remain barren, bereft of even
middle-sized industries, and the Jewish settlements are sterile
""bedroom communities"", havens for (in the main) Israelis (both
secular *and* religious) who work in Tel-Aviv or Jerusalem but
cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs.
There's an old saying: ""bli giboosh, ayn kivoosh"" -- just living there
wasn't enough, we had to *really* settle it. But instead, we ""settled""
for Potemkin villages, and now we are paying the price (and doing

"The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelled
from Jaffa, and/or who fled Jaffa, or anywhere else in Israel, having
the right to return is:  Yes, unfortunately, they have the right to
return.  They may apply for citizenship like any other non-Israeli and
then go to Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who now
own it.
And now a question and answer for you:  Can the Jews who were
born and raised in Hebron, or their descendants go back to THEIR homes
in Hebron?  The answer is: absolutely NOT, because they were almost all
murdered by their Arab neighbors - the ""palestinians"".
Now, do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit

The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time,
pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third
time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were
still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from

and ""human animals"" in his speech at Posen and elsewhere:
From the speech of Reichsfuehrer-SS Himmler, before SS
Major-Generals, Posen, October 4 1943
[""Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression"", Vol. IV, p. 559]
One basic principal must be the absolute rule for the SS man: we
must be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our own
blood and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian, to a Czech,
does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer
in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping
their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in
prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we
need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest
to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion
while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as
the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough
and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans,
who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude
towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these
human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry
about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and
grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone
comes to me and says, ""I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women
and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them"", then I
would have to say, ""you are a murderer of your own blood because
if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and
they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood"".
Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940
[""Trials of Wa Criminals"", Vol. IV, p. 1140]
If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this
I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in
front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides,
provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women
and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this
kind is out of the question.
The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and
where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline
cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp.
This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those
hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict
untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail
in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all -
we all know that - but we need them.

The American press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to

often refered to in the context of anti-abortion protests.  The
American media also uses fundamentalist to refer to Jews who live in

The way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace
after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons:.
1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently
most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or

2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.
It's not relevant whether I agree with you or not, there is some reasonable

Libertarians believe in an end to the welfare state, an end to

down to a reasonable size.
They also believe in a complete end to foreign aid, including

Dorin
Ok. I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However,
i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who
have the right for it.
As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the
current negotiations and the so-called peace process, they
are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions
that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same
for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of ""negotiations"" in Madrid,
and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.
I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have to
loose ?
Arabs feel that the current ""negotiations"" is ONLY for legitimizing the current
status-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and
""oranges"". That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked.

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal
""street strategy"", like SIPDE for example, was the most important
component of any rider education curriculum.  The specific skills of
emergency braking, cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced
as well, but more significant was that 35% of rider did NOTHING
confronted with a potential accident, and another third collided or
fell over as a result of rider error.  The choice of specific maneuver
is much less significant to the outcome than early detection and
the proper execution of ANY effective countermeasure.

"BMW 49'ER RALLY, MAY 27-31  (U.S. Memorial Day Weekend)
San Francisco Bay Area - 20th annual BMW 49'er Rally, sponsored by
The BMW Club of Northern Califronia,  will be held at the Quincy,
California Fairgrounds, from May 27-31, 1993
Included in the $42 pre-registration fee, $47 at gate, are 4 Star
camping, field events and trophies, two dinners, rally pin, door prizes,
Poker Run, vendor displays, Fun Run, English Trials, and live music playing
throughout the weekend.  Plus extras like hot showers, Tours, a Concourse
D'Elegance and more.
This is first time in the 49'er Rally's 20-year history that the
event is being held in Quincy.  And according to Pat Gardner, Rally Chairman,
""The 49'er Rally's continuing growth and the need for a larger and more
complete facility led us to Quincy.  Plus we can get there on either of our
two most favrite highways- Highway 70, which goes through the Feather River
Canyon, or up from the South via the Northernmost part of the Gold Country's
Highway 49.""
Day passes will not be available and non-BMW rider must be a
pre-registered guest of a BMW rider.
The Quincy Fairgrounds is located on California State Highway 70/89,
two miles South of downtown Quincy.
For pre-registration forms and additional information, write Doug
Hubbard, BMW Club of Northern California, 41236 Norman Court, Fremont, CA
94539, or telephone <US (510) 651-2195
This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth.
Whether you've ever attended a rally before or not This is the one
to make.  The only problem has been that there are so
many activities that attendees have to choose one over another.
Quincy is a beautiful campground, lots of grass and little dust.
For folks who have been to previous 49'er rallies at Mariposa,
Quincy has lots of space, all of it flat so room is not a problem.
There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather.
Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us.
Registration will begin on thursday.  Of course there are always early
arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday.  The registration fee pays
for camping Thursday through Monday (5 days).  There will be a tour Friday
with the main events beginning Saturday.  Sunday Evening will be the
awards ceremony.
For members of the various clubs, club awards will be based on
registration declaration of affilitation.  There will of course
be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider < betting 70 +
needed to win and youngest rider ( they get cheater permits at 15.
and greatest distance, one up & two up and all the usual things.

Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering
theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at

And that was my original point.
Mike
While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding,
I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training
must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinion
to know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike
in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.
Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among
new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the
motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the
direction opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.
I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she
is to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the
motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right
handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road.
A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn
the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries
to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.
The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency
situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) of
countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.

only list (and limited to the R80* R100* bikes as well I believe)
I've decided to give this a go and see how much interest there is.
please read all of this post if you plan on subscribing to the list!
there is only one restriction for the discussion on this list, that it
be about BMW's. I don't care which BMW, any and all are welcome. I will
probably post articles that appear in the local BMW club newsletter, and
would incourage other club members to do the same, especially tech
articles.
to subscribe to the list, send a message to the list address:
bmw@rider.cactus.org
with the word SUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message. having
the word SUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to subscribe. if you
put the keyword in the message body, your message will go out to everyone
on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief.
** your From: line must have a valid return address    **
** the list sw will use the address in your From: line **
if you would like to use a return address _other_ than what is contained
in your From: line, do not send mail to the list! send a note directly to
me (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll take care of it manually.
the list sw will hack up the outgoing message From: line so that your
original full name in ()'s is preserved, but the return address is
replaced with the mailing list address (bmw@rider.cactus.org). this
allows you to simply reply to a message to keep it on the list (depending
on your mail interface natch. I use elm so that's what I wrote it for :-).
keep this in mind when you reply to a message and question the authors
parentage.
to remove your name from the list, send a message to the list address
with the word UNSUBSCRIBE (in caps) in the *subject* of the message.
having the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the *subject* is the _only_ way to remove
your name from the list. if you put the keyword in the message body,
your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed
beyond belief.
the list is run from my home system, a poor little 286 box running a
very old version of something that smells somewhat like unix. the MTA
isn't the smartest around, but I've managed to hack it up enough to make
a decent list MTA. additions and removals are handled automatically by
scripts that intercept messages based on the subject (see below) and
may occassionally goof. the sw will send a response message back when you
subscribe. if you do not receive a response within a reasonable amount
of time (my link is via UUCP and sometimes runs in spurts), send me a
message (joe@rider.cactus.org) and I'll look into it.
if the list turns out to be too popular and the MTA groks over the number
of addresses, I'll have to freeze the list recipients until I can come up
with a better MTA.
good luck...

These are the figures from the Performance Bikes lock test, taken without
permission of course. The price is for comparison. All the cable locks
have some sort of armour, the chain locks are padlock and chain. Each
lock was tested for a maximum of ten minutes (600 secs) for each test:
BJ	Bottle jack

Pretty depressing reading. I think a good lock and some common sense about
where and when you park your bike is the only answer. I've spent all my
spare time over the last two weeks landscaping (trashing) the garden of
my (and two friends with bikes) new house to accommodate our three bikes in
relative security (never underestimate how much room a bike requires to
manouver in a walled area :( ). Anyway, since the weekend there are only two
bikes :( and no, he didn't use his Abus closed shackle lock, it was too much
hassle to take with him when visiting his parents. A minimum wait of 8
weeks (if they don't decide to investigate) for the insurance company
to make an offer and for the real haggling to begin.
Abus are a German company and it would seem not well represented in the US
but very common in the UK. The UK distributor, given in the above article
is:
Michael Brandon Ltd,
15/17 Oliver Crescent,
Hawick,
Roxburgh TD9 9BJ.
Tel. 0450 73333
The UK distributors for the other locks can also given if required.

If we do, I think you'd loose.  Sure, you're hand's already on the
throttle.  And your thumb is already near the horn button.  Pushing the
horn button is one simple move.  Revving the throttle requires either
engaging the clutch, or accelerating.  The first is a more complex
manuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright
when there is a potential hazard ahead.  Besides, the unique sound of a
horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than
is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are
on the road!).
As is usually the case, a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound
safety procedure.
The answer is 161.33 feet.

I agree with this 100%.
Me, too... for chihuahua's.  The police and the military don't train
dobermans and shephards and use them as weapons because they are so
easy for the average Joe to defeat barehanded.  You may have opposing
thumbs, but the dog has teeth so effective some of yours are named for
him.  He has IR vision, better hearing and better smell than you do,
and most likely faster reflexes.
You're on a motorcycle, he's on paws.  Roll on and blow him off.  He

Oh bull pucky, Ed. They use dogs because a) Many people are
scared shitless of them and b) because of the nose and the
vision and hearing. Without their cop partner in attendance,
the dog is so much meat in the hands of any human with
a bad attitude and al ittle training in violent force.
Oh horse puckey.  Without their cop partner in attendance, they are less likely
to be controllable *without* the use of force which would kill the dog.
Those teeth aren't very much good with an arm shoved into the
back
of the animals throat and held there, and the neck is not
O.k.  so you've disabled the dog's mouth, and given up use of your arm to do
so.  How `bout them front and read paws, and the fact that to plug up that
mouth you've given the dog the advantage of balance...
espcially strong. neither are the leg joints which can be
easily snapped, or the skull easily crushed, on even the largest
dogs.
Have you ever tried to snap leg or crush the skull of a dog without use of
hardened instruments such as a baseball bat?  Without the use of both arms and
full cooperation of the beastie involved, it's not *that* easy.  Oh, but wait,
you've got your arm shoved in the dogs mouth.  You lose....
Your advice is correct, but a dog is still no match for a trained
human in a fight.
Oh *now* you qualify you earlier statement by saying a *trained* human.

No Mike.  It is imposible due to the shaft effect.  The centripital effects

This is true as evinced by the popularity of shaft-drive drag bikes.

Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer,

Yes, even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering.  Basically to turn left, you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first, causing a counteracting lean to
I guess I was semi-serious. Without using my hands, I lean and the bike
turns. When leaning, a torque is applied, at a 90deg angle to the front
wheel's axle, just as in countersteering. However, this torque is also about
90deg from the axis of the steering head. Instead of making the
bike lean, gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn, but I don't remember
which way.

tolls one must pay on route.  Just before arriving at a toll booth I
switch the hazards on.  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will

Taking gloves off, getting money out of coin changer/pocket, making
transaction, putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the
average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll.
I also notice that when I do this cagers tend to get the message and

This sounds like a VERY good thing to do.

I don't have the grips, but have looked into getting them. it's my
understanding that the grips themselves are the standard european
style grips now coming standard on the 93 bikes (K1100RS, K1100LT, etc).
it's also my understanding that the heater resides _inside_ the bar
itself so if anything I would suspect it would reduce vibration by
providing more bar end mass.
I don't see why they wouldn't work with the old style foam grips aside
from the fact that it might cause the foam to deteriorate or something.
hard to belive considering they do fine in the 100+ degree texas summers.
Someone once sold heated motorcycle grips via mail order.  The were
aftermarket replacement grips that had the heating elements mlded into the
grip itself.  Wires ran outside of the bars, from the grips to a switch and
finaly the battery.  Cycle Magazine tested them YEARS ago and liked them.
Dunno if they are still made.  Might check with the snowmobile racers.

"Hello Folks,
I'm very happy with my ""new"" R80GS.  My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...
that's 50 mpg!!  Surprisingly, the bike is a real cruiser.  I was expecting
something rough.   She's a sweet backroad honey.  And I can go pretty much
anyplace I'd take my mountain bike.  As far as shaft effect, it's more a
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion.  Rev it sitting still
(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit.  Maybe
I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect, but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence.  Okay, here are
my questions:
1) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing?  I'd like to keep the
wind off my chest, and perhaps my helmet, for comfort at highway speeds
(70 mph), yet don't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my
vision too much for trail riding.  Anybody have luck with two-piece
detachible fairings?  I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.
2) I run two lights, the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar.  The illumination's excellent that way, with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor (left side); the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right, and it
really picks up the periphery (deer lurking, etc.)  Combined with the
headlamp on high you can see like day.  But I've heard that BMW alternators
don't crank out too much.  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM?
3) This is embarassing: I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning.  I invariably flood the carbs, then go in and read a section
of the paper, and then she starts right up.  Is this a Zen thing?
4) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives... Yeah, right.  What do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol?  Any
particular brands of gas that are best?  Additives?
Thanks,

Obcountersteer:  For some reason, I've discovered that pulling on the
wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong
side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control.  For
example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn
right (Hi, Lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned
over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive.  Maybe
I need psychological help.

"Hello all,
On my bike I have hazard lights (both front and back turn signals
flash).  Since I live in NJ and commute to NYC there are a number of
tolls one must pay on route.  Just before arriving at a toll booth I
switch the hazards on.  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will
be taking longer than the 2 1/2 seconds to make the transaction.
Taking gloves off, getting money out of coin changer/pocket, making
transaction, putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the
average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll.
I also notice that when I do this cagers tend to get the message and
usually go to another booth.
My question, is this a good/bad thing to do?
Any others tend to do the same?

I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja.
This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride
(read: farther than around the block  :-).  We'll be riding some twisty,
fairly bumpy roads (the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans).
An extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja.
Well, I hate to be a wet sock, but, well...
I was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started
riding myelf, and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes.  The passenger
seats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren't
even usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my
back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the
reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had
a BMW. :)
I'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains
or some such.  Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there.
The best advice I'd give a beginning passenger:
- Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort
signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on
the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop
he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.
- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider
asks you to :)
- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements
and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,
but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.
- Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably
consistent shifting style).  Avoid ""helmet bonk.""  Helmet bonk is
when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change
in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It
gets old real fast.
- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep
your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands
on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain,
but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.
- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be
sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're
still there. :)  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.
- Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or
losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed
for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.

"Because riding a passenger doesn't really depend on the type of bike.
The things you want a passenger to do/not do is the same.  Ergo, if he's
asking advice, I reasoned he doesn't have much practice, period.  If
you say he does, fine.  I still wouldn't take the uninitiated up a
road that's all switch backs and reverse/center/uncrowned roadway, not
to mention the BDCs and squids who will also be on that particular
road.  He asked for advice, and even though it wasn't what he meant,
I still consider it some of the best I've read.

you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when

Yeah, I had an XS750 that was the same. The valve seats tend to wear
very slowly, and anything that might get taken off the pad (which shouldn't
really wear) will tend to compensate - so it's a sort of self-compensating
system.

I did some back-of-the-eyelids calculations last night, and I figure
these puppies suck up about 10 amps to work at maximum efficiency (i.e., the

Don't forget about the culture.  Sadly, we don't (as a society) look upon
homosexuality as normal (and as we are all too well aware, there are alot
of people who condemn it).  As a result, the gay population is not encouraged
to develop ""non-promiscuous"" relationships.  In fact there are many roadblocks
put in the way of such committed relationships.  It is as if the heterosexual
community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays
are immoral.  ""My, if we allowed gays to marry, raise children ... we might

A short comment:
As you may recall, the early Christians were pacifists preferring to
avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner.
The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city.
Despite some pious legends, the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days. We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups. For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
(especially after centuries of political instability and terror), the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of. When studied with a
knowledge of cult psychology, Acts is eerily familiar, especially today.
Huh ??
This kind of shotgun blast deserves either to be elaborated upon,
or retracted. Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what the
writer is referring to, it should be incumbent on Mr. Erwin to back up what
he says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two.
(For example, ""Simon Zealotes"" = the certain apostle having a nickname
connected to a Jewish terrorist group)
Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference to
Christians made above - he is quite silent as to the fate of the Jewish
Christian Church in Jerusalem, even though he took the time to
record the death of St. James (brother of St. John). On the subject of the
fate of Jesus's family, including James (the brother of Jesus) we learn
nothing from Josephus.
Likewise, Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly
vicious people, getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong in
the process. But even though Tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunity
to learn much about the Christians during his tour in Asia Minor under
Domitian, we find little to enlighten ourselves about the Christians
in either the _Histories_ or the _Annals_
The writer's interpretation of _Acts_ is purely subjective as
stated, and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspects
of ""cult psychology"" are to be found there. I can think of a thing or two
offhand, but I'd like to give Mr. Erwin the opportunity to demonstrate his own
knowledge satisfactorily before throwing out any more hints.

the jury is hung ... neither good news from the government's point of
view, as they desparately needed some scapegoats in Los Angeles.
Wrong on both accounts.
Maybe by making the announcement at 7:00 AM on the west coast, they
figure all the rioters will be asleep, giving the troops time to move

Sorry to disappoint you, but this seems unlikely.
The Mayor of
Los Angeles, in a press conference about 3:00 AM Saturday morning, in
announcing that the jury would give its verdict later this morning
(just an hour away as I write this) would not say what that verdict
is, but I think he was told ... in his press conference he said
""anyone rioting will be stopped dead in their tracks ...""
I don't think he was told.
However, his statement was still appropriate.
Meanwhile, following the announcement of the jury's verdict, the
judge, jury and assorted court personnel will be evacuated from the
building via helicopters landing on the roof of the courthouse. They
can't  even walk out through the front door with their heads held
high.
Jury duty is a solemn duty to be taken seriously.  It is not meant
to be a source of pride or instant fame.
Won't the rioters have a surprise waiting for them when they wake up
later today!
Well, the many *people* who got up early to go to the court to hear
the verdict found that justice was served.  Given your dire and

For starters, they could have gone on waiting and negotiating.  The Davidians
weren't going anywhere, and their supplies had to be limited.  Large, perhaps,
but limited.  If they had simply fired the compound by themselves without
gov't tanks smashing down their walls, then at least the gov't would not be
guilty of having _again_ used an inappropriate level of force, and would have
been able to use the meantime to continue to pressure and negotiate.  No, they
would not have looked good on the news in six months or a year.  But they sure
as hell don't look very good now.
True.  Today's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church
leader who is now a consultant on cults.  He said the FBI's approach
was totally wrong.  He said they should have tried to break down the
BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means.   Koresh's whole
theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces
of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this.  The Feds
played into his hands **PERFECTLY**.   By surrounding the compound
with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them
they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was
evil and threatening.    He said instead they should have set up
a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly.  If they
broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving
relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'
childhoods.   The idea is to make the outside world and surrender
seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative.   Interesting comments.

I couldn't disagree with you more strongly.  It sounds good, but in
practice it too often becomes tyranny, because there are too often
conflicting ideas of what constitutes ""improving the human condition"".
Far better to let people and their organizations pursue whatever goals
they think best, and let ""the human condition"" be improved by those who
are willing to do so without coercion.
There will always be conflicting ideas on what constitutes ""improving the
human condition"", that's humanity. You seem to believe that libertarianism
will improve the human condition by lifting all constraints, and that
people will have a better chance of improving themselves in that environment.
Let me try to put it another way.  Libertarians believe that an
unconstrained environment provides the best chance of solving any
problem because it maximizes creativity.  However, there is never
any guarantee that a really good solution will ever be found to any
particular problem.  ""Utopia is not an option.""
Utopia is a myth (although we can do a lot better than what we have today).
But I think that you must pitch Libertarianism as a progressive agenda
(ie You can do better under our style of system).
I admire a lot of what the Libertarians stand for, but you
guys are some of the worst salesmen I have ever seen. And when it comes to
politics, you need salesmen whether you want them or not.
What we need are more people who agree with us, know something
about marketin, and are willing to both do that marketing and teach
others how to.  Are you in?
I'm flattered by your invitation, but I'm afraid you have the wrong person.
Although I completely agree with your civil liberties agenda, I'm not
in support of your economic agenda. What I DO like about the Libertarian

Critisism is too easy. What solutions do people have that  would have been
better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months?
Firstly, they could have backed off.  When you put a power freak, like
David Koresh, in that kind of situation he is going to explode.  (no pun
intended).  Koresh wanted to be a martyr and the government played right into
his hands.
If the government hadn't given him the attention he wanted nothing
would have ever happened.
Secondly, the Davidians were expecting everything the government did.
They thought that they were facing the apocalypse, and that they were to perish
in fire.  They weren't scared of the FBI.  They are not the average hoods, they
are very devout followers of a religion.  PsyOps didn't work and the government
got frustrated so they murdered them.
The BATF should have left at the beginning, they should have looked at
Koresh's personality.  Instead they thought, ""They have guns.  We have bigger
guns.  Let's go get 'em!""
They botched it from day one.  They shouldn't have been there in the
first place.
The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the
Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush.
Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy. There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated. They set out to obtain a legal warrant and
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell.

those on the scene see is a bunch of men with guns storming
their compound and lobbing grenades at them.  The terms of the
search warrent are secret and the BATF has yet to even reveal
what they were.

They did not serve a warrent, they basically attacked the
compound and expected a surrender.  They had semiautomatics and
concussion grenades that we KNOW about.
Look at the death and injury toll inflicted on both sides in the first
battle and its difficult to believe that either side had any

"In a previous article, mechalas@gn.ecn.purdue.edu (John P. Mechalas) says:
So what if the FBI wasn't aware of suicide plans?  This may not even be an
]accurate statement, anyway, since the last report of listening devices used
in the compound may reveal new information.  We'll have to wait.
Yeah, we may have to wait till hell freezes over. If they had listening
devices in place, one would think they would have audiotapes as a result.
Why, when officials are asked about what those devices picked up, do they
stumble around and never answer the question? If they have them, I think
people have a right to hear the tapes.
And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say?  Their credibility
is shot anyway, since they *origianlly* said that Koresh was going to surrender
after the Passover.  We saw how accurate that was.
I don't contend that Koresh wasn't a liar. That's not really the issue.
The issue is did the federal agents use the most prudent measures available
in ""ending"" this fiasco (that in my opinion was bungled from the
very beginning)?
And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside.  Outside
meaning outside the compound?  Yes, the FBI reported seeing two people
(according to CNN reports) using torches to set the compound on fire.   They
were outside.
I don't know, and neither do you unless you were there, who started the
fire. I hope we find out, but I have my doubts.
Either way, I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves.
Could you please show us this evidence that you have? Right now a lot
of people on all sides of this issue are making conflicting statements
right and left. Some real live evidence would be most welcome!
You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the ""destruction of the people"".  All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible.
In my opinion, it is possible that the actions of the FBI: a) indirectly,
b) directly but not intentionally, or c) intentionally (I hope not the
latter, but we would be naive to discount this possibility entirely) caused
the fire. It is possible that someone inside the community started
the fire because they ""thought"" God told them to or because they simply
would rather die than surrender. Who knows?
We are left with some compelling questions here, besides the above. Why
haven't the droves of news reporters commented on whether or not they
heard shots coming from within the compound once the tank (I don't
remember its technical name) started ramming down the door? It seems
to me that gunshots would be audible at 2.5 to 3 miles away.
Why couldn't the FBI wait until Koresh wrote his manuscript, as they
had promised they would. Does the fact that Koresh lied justify the
FBI's lying as well?
Will an ""internal investigation"" really reveal what happened, if in fact
the BATF and FBI are at least partly to blame?
How will we ever know if Koresh broke the law as was alleged in the
now-unsealed (finally!) warrant? Certainly we won't find out in a
court of law.
There's been a lot of talk about why the people didn't run out when
the fire started, but one survivor said that the tank had collapsed the
stairway and entryway and that the majority of the people were trapped.
Only those in another part of the house escaped.
People have commented on the unwillingness of the woman who came running
out of the house with her clothes ablaze to remain outside rather than
going back in. When was the last time you had your clothes on fire? Who
the heck knows if you'd know which way you were running and why? I think
the FBI agent who grabbed her and pulled her to safety acted heroically,
btw. I'm certainly not trying to paint a picture of the ""evil feds""
by any means. I simply question the decisions from start to finish
that led to the horrible tragedy of yesterday.

If the FBI started the fire, why didn`t people flee the

Assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about

perhaps they didn't flee because fleeing would have meant ENTERING the
fire from the other side?  Like they were surrounded by the fire, and
rubble, which finally (combined with teargas, and combustion gasses)
overcame and enveloped them?
In other words they were TRAPPED by the flames, heat, fumes and rubble?
Wait a minute.  The story being pushed here is that the fire started
in ONE PLACE.  This is not consistent with the story that they were
TRAPPED by the fire (particularly in a building that all of a sudden
had many more exits).
Choose one, please.
What if.......
What if the FBI thought that tear gas would force the Davidians out;
at least the mothers and the children, so they (the FBI) did not
bother to think about the effect of tear gas on young children......
What if the FBI knew they killed several of the children by using
tear gas......(let`s assume the FBI knew via their listening devices)
What if the FBI saw fire accidently break out at one end of the
building, e.g. by an upset oil lamp.......
What if the FBI thought they could finally force the rest of the
Davidians out AND also destroy the evidence that they (the FBI) had
killed the children by starting a fire at the other end......
What if the FBI miscalculated and not many of the rest of the Davidians
made it out.......?????

I'm really surprised Clinton hasn't already tried to do this.  He seems

Considering that Clinton received a draft notice and got out of it (he admits it) the political feasibility of him abolishing it is not something he would
be inclined to risk any extra exposure on.
Let me say this about that, as a retired Navy officer;
I agree. Cut it.  But let's not stop there.
Eliminate the C-17 transport.
Wrong.  We need its capability.  Sure it has its problems, very few
airplanes haven't, but getting rid of something we need is not the
answer.  What do you want to do, start over a rebuild a new airplane
from scatch?  It'll have its problems as well and there will be calls
again, for it to be scrapped.  THe other option is to try to extend
the life of the C-5s and C-141s that are getting extremely old.
If you read Aviation Week, the C-5 line can be reopened and the C-5s
would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the
program. Politically, though, the C-17 is popular pork.
Scrap the Seawolf SSN-21 nuclear submarine.
Ground the B-2 stealth bomber.
It'll cost jobs, but I'm for it.  We especially don't need a B-2. THe
SSN-21, I know litttle about.
Agreed. Congress took money from NASA and FHA to fund the second Seawolf.
The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there
is a lack of ASW foes to contend with. The Navy is considering reducing
the number of attack subs to 40 (Navy Times) and that would entail
getting rid of or mothballing some of the current Los Angeles class.
Politically, General Dynamics is in Connecticut and we will get
Seawolf subs whether we need them or not.
In addition, more bases need to be closed. Probably Long Beach Naval Station
and others. The Navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being
required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships.
The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down
a pork happy Congress.

If that were the case, the slave states would not have passed so many

That has not been demonstrated.  Had he come to trial, there was a very real

They ""rang the doorbell"" using a concussion grenade!  And if the bloody
warrants were ""legal"" then why were they _sealed_ after the fight started?
And if Koresh had declared himself a ""private state"" and was just daring the
gov't to go in, then why did he surrender last year to a local sheriff who
served a warrant _for_his_arrest_ (as opposed to the BATF search warrant,
which did not include arrest unless violations were found) by just calling
him up to tell him and then going out to collect him with his squad car?
That doesn't sound like a dictator to me, it sounds like someone who knows
he has a court battle.  Things might have gone very differently if the BATF

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked

This is stupid.  That is no paranoid assertion, it is testamony from surviving
witnesses, and the BATF _has_ no tanks, nor am I aware of either the BATF _or_
the FBI using any until yesterday.  When they use maximum force they do just
what they did that first day that got four officers killed.
The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police.
""Underarmed""?  You flabberghast me, they were loaded for bear and every
picture shows them wearing bullet-proof vests!  They were using concussion
grenades and full-auto weapons, what was missing low-yield tac-nukes?  This
is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount
of force used, both initially and yesterday.  You should be ashamed.
If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could

They _had_ a sure-fire method: keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looney-tune religious
stunt.

with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the Holocaust, a process
that is in place _now_ in this country, even if the tattered, pitiful remains
of the Constitution is slowing its progress.  This isn't a Libertarian issue,
others may argue that line, but from a strictly Constitutional view of a
democratic gov't, what the FBI and BATF did was wrong, wrong, wrong, even if
their _reasons_ for trying to arrest Koresh were 100% right.  _Anything_ that
leads to the deaths of 17 children, if nothing else touches your stoney
heart, is _wrong_ no matter who pushed the button.  For God's sake, man, get

Of course, one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government
power (and keeps it circumscribed) in a complex society when it is in the
interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using
government power for their own ends.  But apart from that little
conundrum...
This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good
solution.  One approach is simply to try and move political opinion
and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Another
approach is to try and amend the constitution.  The original
constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention
for 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it.
The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrains
government (particularly state and local), even though on many
particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I think
libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via
an amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).
Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this as
a problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That might
be true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  If
a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then
falls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This is
unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held
for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now,
but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of,
if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.

I may be a little dense but I would have thought that protecting consumers
from scam insurance companies would be the prime objective of something
called the Cal insurance Commission. If they aren't accomplishing that now
then why do we need them?
Very simple.  An 'Insurance Commissioner' is a bureaucrat - a regulator.
It is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws.  He/she cannot
make laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say
scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have
to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For
the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative
bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all
know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp.
along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So
Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance
of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam
companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to
have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.

We need jobs because at this point in the recovery, the economy

we put into selective service now will get us $10 less spending

I really believe now to think about it that selective service

A more realistic offer would be:
Those who object to paying for abortion can instead pay for the (greater)
cost of delivery that those who couldn't afford an abortion (and wanted
one) would be forced to go through, while those of us who do not object to
public funding of abortions for those who can not afford medical care on
their own can pay for the (smaller) cost of an abortion for those who
decide that is what is best for them, but are unable to afford it on their

abortions end up paying *more* money than if they hadn't objected.  People
need to realize that where *your* individual tax money goes is a meaningless

*one* entire abortion.  (Consider how many taxpayers there are, how many

cost.  I think the factors on the order of 1/1000 involved will swamp the

I assume you are saying that no-knock warrants are 'unreasonable', this

There was no evidence the woman in question was a prostitute, the

difference. Err, perhaps Clayton doesn't know the difference.
Evidence given for her prostitute status, besides the admittedly
questionable claim of the man on trial included:
1. Prior employment in a number of massage parlors, with women who
claimed that she worked as a prostitute;
2. Walking around a truck stop at 4:00 AM wearing a lace miniskirt,
a halter top, and no underwear of any sort;
3. Not having a purse or other I.D. with her.
Not enough to convict her, but enough to create reasonable doubt

"A short comment:
As you may recall, the early Christians were pacifists preferring to
avoid
physical confrontation rather than dealing with it in like manner.
The mother church of Jerusalem disappeared when the Romans took the city.
Despite some pious legends, the evidence seems to be that the members of
the church died fighting the Romans during what they believed to be the
last days. We know that certain Apostles had nicknames connecting them to
Jewish terrorist groups. For the average inhabitant of the Roman Empire
(especially after centuries of political instability and terror), the
Roman policies in Palestine were heartily approved of. When studied with a

Oh, *really*???
I know that more than 50% of an average daily worker's salary goes

It looks like we are pretty lucky so far.
I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware
that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees
were listed seperately on my pay stub.
While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks
in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ...
A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our
major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president
Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers,
and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in
the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance
to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones
before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had
shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private
system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are
considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of
traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly ""libertarian""
faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average
Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these).
Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used
in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in
a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a
lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic
health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does
allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on
the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.  Plenty of
room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as
Lastly, there were noises about how the Canadian system was not
containing costs, but, in fact, their system is currently bankrupt.

Really? Pure Socialism had this belief, and fell flat on its ass by
attempting to follow such reasoning. Suppose you pass a law that
states that I must love my neighbour, regardless of race, religion,
etc. How exactly do you plan to enforce such a law? Better yet, how
do you plan to measure compliance? And even if you overcome those
two obstacles, how will you ever know if I have become *more moral*
or not?
You either missed the point or are being somewhat disingenuous;  I have
never heard anyone suggest that you can legislate what people think.
Laws are based on either expediency (i.e. traffic laws) or morality (i.e.
human rights), as far as I can tell, and the majority are based on the
latter.
Once more around the racetrack. See the original statement that it is
nonsense to believe that you cannot legislate morality. I simply stated
that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them
will make you or I more moral people. They may make us act in a moral
manner, but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to
risk punishment. They say nothing about whether we have become more
moral or not. Perhaps the distinction is too fine.

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked

in a tank and broken the door down on day one.
This is stupid.  That is no paranoid assertion, it is testamony from surviving
witnesses, and the BATF _has_ no tanks, nor am I aware of either the BATF _or_
the FBI using any until yesterday.  When they use maximum force they do just
what they did that first day that got four officers killed.

The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police.
""Underarmed""?  You flabberghast me, they were loaded for bear and every
picture shows them wearing bullet-proof vests!  They were using concussion
grenades and full-auto weapons, what was missing low-yield tac-nukes?  This
is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount
of force used, both initially and yesterday.  You should be ashamed.
We were having a discussion about whether Bush would have done anything
differently. On the basis of Panama, Grenada, Tripoli, Kewait etc we
decided that Bush would have asked for a surgical airstrike  or used a
cruise missile, some people suggested that he would have used the nuke
warhead cruise, others pointed out that he would be too cheap to use 'em.
What was missing? Armoured vehicles!
If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it.
They _had_ a sure-fire method: keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looney-tune religious
stunt.
Phil, I've been reading your postings for months and I'm convinced that you
will back anything, no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone
else's rights if you think it will hurt people you don't like.  It's people
with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the Holocaust, a process
that is in place _now_ in this country, even if the tattered, pitiful remains
of the Constitution is slowing its progress.  This isn't a Libertarian issue,
others may argue that line, but from a strictly Constitutional view of a
democratic gov't, what the FBI and BATF did was wrong, wrong, wrong, even if
their _reasons_ for trying to arrest Koresh were 100% right.  _Anything_ that
leads to the deaths of 17 children, if nothing else touches your stoney
heart, is _wrong_ no matter who pushed the button.  For God's sake, man, get
your morality back.
The person who murdered 17 children was Koresh. He kept them there and
brought about their deaths deliberately.
You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap.
Thats quite true. I don't pretend to be. Being nice is what amateurs
try to do. If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions
such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting
to rescue the children. Anyone who has held the office of President
of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA
or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear
Holocaust in order to protect freedom. Beleive it or not, that is not
the sort of threat that nice chaps make. Do they have a gun nutters
section of the US version of CND by any chance?
There are cases where society has to be protected from
madmen such as Koresh or Hitler. If it were not for the consideration
of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would
not be a matter of anything but academic significance. It is not for
the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide.
The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to
leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire. If proven
that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to
promote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero.
I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in
this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse.

The left likes to dodge the issues of morality and behavior, crying that
anyone who raises them ""blames the victim.""  Nonetheless, as a recent
editorial in the {Los Angeles Times} pointed out, the free love
advocates of the 1960's have demolished the poor.  It's one thing to
have children out of wedlock if you're, say, Murphy Brown (or someone
like her), turning over a six figure salary -- and quite another if
you're sixteen, have no skills, and no income.
And how did the ""free love advocates of the 1960's"" manage to perform
this demolition--forced breeding programs or something?
By accepting and even celebrating single, out-of-wedlock parenthood, the
1960's radicals espousing free love set the stage for catastrophe among
the poor. They must account for this...
Now let me get this straight.  After a nice, long rant about how
people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and
social lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, I guess)
are responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  Tell me how that
works--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think
for themselves?
There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and
support systems in general among this nation's poor.  Somehow I
don't think Murphy Brown--or Janis Joplin--is at the top of any
sane person's list.

[With a tip of the hat to David Letterman for making the Top Ten format

Top Ten Reasons that Conservatives don't want to aid Russia:
<looking around  Who?  Where?
Don't look at me.  I want to send aid to Russia.  Many other
conservatives do as well.
Yes, it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia.  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around.
Enemy?  Sounds like that's the viewpoint of the stereotypical rednecked
conservative -- 'always been commies, always will be.'  I suggest you
listen very carefully to the stuff Yeltsin and his people are saying
and compare that with the very anti-West slogans coming from his
opponents in the Russian congress.  I sure know who I want to back.
Oh, BTW, Germany has sure come back as a terrible enemy after WWII,
hasn't it?
It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with
free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic
competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.
Better to let them degenerate into civil war?  Remember all those
nuclear weapons in Russia.  I cannot imagine that they would not
be used in a civil war.  If nationialists take over and, even if
they prevent a civil war, most feel they must take back large
parts of land that are in other countries (like Ukraine.)  I also cannot
imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight, possibly nuclear.
How does this affect us?  Well, we are on the same planet and if
vast tracks of Europe are blown away I think we'd feel something.
A massive breakup of a country that spans 1/6th the planet is
bound to have affects here.  (Of course, there is also the
humanitarian argument that democracies should help other
democracies (or struggling democracies).)
I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution
was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.
Seriously.  Everyone has different opinions on what is stupid.
My two ""causes"" are aid to Russia and a strong space program.
Someone else will champion welfare or education or doing studies
of drunken goldfish.  That is why we have a republic and not a
true democracy.  Instead of gridlock on a massive scale, we
only have gridlock on a congressional scale.
BTW, who is to decide 'stupid?'  This is just like those who
want to impose their 'morals' on others -- just the sort of
thing I thought Libertarians were against.
Actually, my politics are pretty Libertarian except on this one issue
and this is why it is impossible for me to join the party.  It seems
that Libertarians want to withdraw from the rest of the world and
let it sink or swim.  We could do that 100 years ago but not now.
Like it or not we are in the beginnings of a global economy and
global decision making.

Excuse me?  WHO destroyed the BD's?  Last I knew, they burned themselves...
Where did you get this information?  The FBI stated they were not

So what if the FBI wasn't aware of suicide plans?
That means that BD's had no plans to commit suecide.
This may not even be an
]accurate statement, anyway, since the last report of listening devices used
in the compound may reveal new information.  We'll have to wait.
Are you saying the FBI may have actually received information that BD's were
going to burn themselves alive and did not stop the assault?  Even if that
were true, you gotta be kidding if you expect them to release that kind of
information to the public.
And what did you expect Koresh's attorneys to say?  Their credibility
is shot anyway, since they *origianlly* said that Koresh was going to surrender
after the Passover.  We saw how accurate that was.
That's not what Koresh's attorney said on Larry King's Live. He said
that Koresh was not going to come out before the Passover, and that he and
his leutenant were ""working day and night"" on some kind of religious
manuscript (something about the Seven Seals) and that once they finished
they would come out.  K.'s attorney also said that the day before the
assault an armored vehicle delivered typewriter supplies to the compound,
and that the FBI promised many times there would not be another attack,
that the matters would be resolved peacefully.
And the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside.  Outside
meaning outside the compound?
No, they meant that BD's did not set the place on fire.
Yes, the FBI reported seeing two people
(according to CNN reports) using torches to set the compound on fire.   They
were outside.
That was the initial claim, but I do not believe it has been repeated
since.  Anyway, I'd like to see a tape.  The FBI surely videotaped
the whole operation. All conversations must have been recorded too.
How come the two were not shot by the FBI snipers?
Either way, I have evidence to support the theory that the BD's burned
themselves.
What evidence?
You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
for the fire and the ""destruction of the people"".   All you have done is
put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
up your claim that the FBI was responsible.
That is what the survivors claim.  I'd like to see some evidence
that people that everyone agrees were not going to commit suecide
actually did it.

Probably because if they pick her the Republicans will investigate

Could you please supply (with a post, preferably) some proof of this,

Well, your ignorance about this is unsurprising, given you're a

interested in this, given that it is an American issue which should
properly be of absolutely no concern to you at all.
Actually, my interest in gender issues is not limited to international
boundaries.  Indeed, I often exchange information with Americans about
issues which concern us, in both countries.
In any event, in
answer to your question, the following is taken from David Brock's
article, ""The Real Anita Hill"", published in the March 1992 issue of
_The_American_Spectator_.  [This is taken from page 27.]
Ah...someone had mentioned this journal, but gave no further information.
But the most bizarre incident is alleged to have happened in the
school year 1983-84 at Oral Roberts [University], according to a
sworn affidavit, dated October 13, 1991, and filed with the Senate
Judiciary Committee, in which Lawrence Shiles, now a lawyer in
Tulsa, recounted the following:
Shortly after the class had begun, Professor Hill gave us a
written assignment which I completed and duly turned in.  When
this assignment was passed out to the class after having been
marked by [the] professor, sitting next to me were fellow
students Jeffrey Londoff and Mark Stewart.  Upon opening the
assignments and reviewing our grades and comments made by Anita
Hill, I found ten to twelve short black pubic hairs in the pages
of my assignment.  I glanced over at Jeff Londoff's assignment
and saw similar pubic hairs in his work.  At the time I made the
statement to Londoff that either she had a low opinion of our
work or she had graded our assignment in the bathroom.  Mark
Stewart overheard the conversation and said that he had similar
pubic hairs in his assignment also.  This became the standing
joke among many students for the remainder of the year in
classes.
Other students in that class confirmed the story.  Londoff says
he couldn't be certain that the hairs were pubic, but he said he
thought it was unlikely that they could have come from Hill's head,
since they were short, coarse, and curly, and Hill had had the hair
on her head straightened.  Another student who saw the hair, but
did not want to be identified, said of its origins: ""You just know
when you see it.""
Does this satisfy you,
Yes, thank you, though I am really curious as to why this never came out
(at least not in what I saw, up here in Canada, or on CNN, which is sent
up here) during the Thomas nomination hearings.  Surely, one would think
that her claim to having been sexually harassed, would have a great deal

People who criticize ""big Government"" and its projects rarely seem to
have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and
technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of
supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too
long-term.
(Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because
of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to
compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't
has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)
This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into
the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There
was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of
state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.
The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was
mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that
many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with
low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for
travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a
university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well
as salary.
During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure
scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they
were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is
probably because of the ""research mind"" approach, which is not to try
to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution
emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to
discussion about their problems, the job got done.
The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the
future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was
unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the
future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as
NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly
keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,
making it more difficult for them to act to support research.
The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which
the government supports research the university will not provide funding,
and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,
as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of
a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask
for one?  The answer I will get is, ""Get the money from NSF.""  Now the
money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it
comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from
getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects
get supported, and how much.
Also, the government decided that the ""wealth"" should be spread.  So instead
of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research
institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into
being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating
reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal
has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals
already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am
proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find
impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow
I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea
which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to
something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast,
and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it
is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring
more than minimal attention of a good researcher.
I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would
have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government
is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.

A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough

the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2
percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.
The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday

the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional

So there are less gays, then the gays claim.

Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the

Deleted: vast quantities of carefully-annoted spew from ""David Koresh""
I don't know about the rest of you, but I think Mr. Tice needs a hobby.
He has one. He spent last summer telling everyone who doubted the word
of the great Perot that they were bigotted perot-bashers, right up to the
moment he chickened out on them. He then kept quiet for a bit and then
came back when Perot re-entered.
I am avidly collecting Koresh rumours, the nuttier the better. So far I
have three posts in my mailbox claiming that the Warrant for the search
1) Never existed.
2) Did not authorize ""no knock"", helicopters etc.
3) Was completely irrelevant because the laws wer unconstitutional.
I am avidly trying to locate a copy of the ""Book of Koresh"" that a number
have claimed exist.
Then there is the rumour that Loresh in fact survived the fire in a secret
hideyhole and rose again on the third day only to be spirited away by
FBI agents and disposed of in order to prevent a cult following.
The source of the fire is variously attributed to a deliberate act on the
part of the FBI, an accident or an act of God.
In the same way I really like the ""miracle amunition belt"" story. The
idea being that in a just cause God will supply amunition ""fear not
for the Lord himself shall place the arrows in your bow"". Neat eh? The
BATF agents were thus definitively shot by the will of God himself. I
can't see why they needed the million rounds of ammo though in that
case.
If you have some Koresh material that hasn't gone to the net then please
send it to me. In particular I really do want to see the book of Koresh,
but no making one up please. I want the real Mcoy, the one the Feds
discoverd on the third day in a box with seven seals and are suppressing.
I will editorialize for the benefit of the net to produce a ""definitive""
history.
I would prefer though to have genuine rather than made to measure Koreshia.
There are plenty of genuinly unhinged loons so as to not need to start
making it up. Of course if you are an unhinged loon then I want to hear

The default condition, in the absence of a preponderance of
evidence either way, is that the proposition or assertion is undecidable.
And the person who takes the undecidable position and says that he/she
simply disbelieves that the proposition is true, is the only one who
holds no burden of proof.  This is why the so-called ""weak atheist""
position is virtually unassailable -- not because it stands on a firm
foundation of logical argument, but because it's proponents simply
disbelieve in the existence of God(s) and therefore they hold no burden
of proof.  When you don't assert anything, you don't have to prove
anything.  That's where weak atheism draws its strength.  But its
strength is also its Achilles' heel.  Without assertions/axioms, one
has no foundation upon which to build.  As a philosophy, it's virtually
worthless.  IMO, of course.
Yes, as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless.  This is true in
exactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief in
Zeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophies
from many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the same
way as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts.
Atheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christians
base theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.
The ""weak atheist"" position is logically extremely assailable -- any
logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it
as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak
atheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with
attempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all fail
miserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the
""strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist"" position do so on this
basis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the arguments
presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound;
therefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do
not exist.  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as are
defined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods of
popular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quite
questionable.

that I Cor 16:2 doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service.
Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Christians are required to observe

Before you go absolving the BATF & FBI of all blame in this incident, you should
probably be aware of two important facts.
1.  There is no such thing as non-toxic tear gas.  Tear gas is non-breathable
remaining in it's presence will cause nausea and vomiting, followed eventually
by siezures and death.  Did the FBI know the physical health of all the people
they exposed??  Any potential heart problems among the B-D's??
2.  Have you ever seen a tear gas canister??  Tear gas is produced by burning a
chemical in the can.  The fumes produced are tear gas.  The canister has a
warning printed on the side of it.  ""Contact with flamable material can result
in fire.""  Now, how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building
they admited was a fire-trap??
This whole thing was a case of over-reaction by the officials at every step.
I hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are held
accountable.  But that is highly unlikely when you figure they are going to

"However, I have read a book:
GA Wells, _Did_Jesus_Exist_
I found it to be thorough and interesting, but perhaps not the end of the
story.
Perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the Bible as evidence relating
to questions of science.
There is a great fallacy in your statement. The question of origins is
based on more than science alone.  If you met a man who could walk on
water, raise people from the dead, claimed to be the Son of God, and
then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures, this would affect
your belief in the origin of man.  (I can expand on this.)  Science and
the Bible are not in contradiction.  God can supercede the scientific
""laws"" as man understands them.  Creation is a good example.  God has the
power to create something out of nothing, order out of chaos.
If the title of the book you mentioned has anything to do with the
substance of the book, it must be a real laugher.  Of course Jesus existed,
and there are volumes of evidence to back it up.  I can give many if you
are interested.
If I were to experience this strange creature for myself perhaps...
However, one highly biased account (as well as possibly internally
inconsistent) written over 2 mellenia ago, in a dead language, by fanatic
devotees of the creature in question which is not supported by other more
objective sources and isnt  even accepted by those who's messiah this creature
was supposed to be, doesn't convince me in the slightest, especially when many
of the current day devotees appear brainwashed into believing this pile of
guano...
Since you have referred to the Messiah, I assume you are referring
to the New Testament.  Please detail your complaints or e-mail if
you don't want to post.  First-century Greek is well-known and
well-understood.  Have you considered Josephus, the Jewish Historian,
who also wrote of Jesus?  In addition, the four gospel accounts
are very much in harmony.

I don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either.  They are extremely useful
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make.
Other posters have aptly explained the atomic model.  Gravity, too, is
very much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but we
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
objects by this thing we _call_ gravity.  Gravity, however, is _not_
a fact.  It is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects
behave in our physical environment.  Newton thought gravity was a
simple vector force; Einstein a wave. Both are very useful models that
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly
the way the theory now formulated talks about it.  That takes a great

Perhaps the major difference here is that we notice something, which we call
gravity, and then do some modelling around it.  I myself do not notice any
deity.  Hence a model cannot be made.  A deity is an abstract, and hence
religion may be considered a model of an abstract.
Besides, we can always change the model of gravity if the one we have doesn't
work too well.  Can you imagine this with the bible?  Erm, excuse me, I bought

"The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line
up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition.
Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood
beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3
conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to
publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed
to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it
backed away from the ""Family Values"" positons of the '92 convention.
Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization
with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications
support.
The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version
of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes.
Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom
Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.
Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989
to manage Legatus, a ""nonpolitical"", Catholic businessmen's group.
Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4
million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts
at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the
Catholic Campaign.
The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep.
Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely
Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national
committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's
American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas
Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an
active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.
The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec
and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank
Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida
of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork.
In the Winter 1992 issue of _Campaign Update_ the organization's
quarterly newsletter, Rocco L. Martino, a Philadelphia business
executive wrote: ""Separation of church and state is a false premise
that must finally be cast aside and replaced by the true meaning of
our constitution.""
Oh yes, the organization's ""national ecclesisatical advisor"" is
Catholic politician Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York.

Mike,
I've seen referrences to ""Creation vs Evolution"" several times in a.a
and I have question. Is either point of view derived from direct
observation; can either be scientific? I wonder if the whole
controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the ""Truth""
rather than the truth itself.
Both sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome, and I can't help
wondering which came first. As I've pointed out elsewhere, my view of
human nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing
anyhthing objectively - all knowledge is inherently subjective. So, in
the context of a.a, would you take a stand based on what you actually
know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell
the difference?

Hardly.  Saying that homosexuality is a sin is a far cry from

a homosexual babysitting for my kids doesnt mean I endorse
""Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash"".
We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression
towards those we feel don't 'measure up',
And now we have homosexual advocates telling us that if we don't teach
our kids that homosexuality is natural and a perfectly acceptable
alternative lifestyle, then they will have it done for us.  No, thanks.
The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to ""include""
people.
Absolutely.  And the message is always, ""go and sin no more"".  Not,
Go and do whatever ""feels good"".
One question, at the start of your post, you wrote:
I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free
form discrimination...I may have lost face with the greater Christian
community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists
against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and
treated as runaway slaves for being ""nigger-lovers"" and such.  I guess I've
decided the challenge is worth it.
This sounds real nice, but struck me as a little odd.  You're
presenting yourself as if you were a straight Xian, who is sticking
his neck out and taking on the challenge of speaking out in support
of gays in the church.  But I was under the impression that you
yourself are gay.  That's all well and fine, but presenting yourself
as sticking out your neck to help ""repressed others"" seems a bit
untruthful under the circumstances....

The sweating of blood in Gethsemene is
not a basic Mormon doctrine.  Jesus did not perform the atonement
in Getheseme alone, as some anti-Mormons are trying to teach.
As far as the ""unpardonable sin"" whatever that is, it is Biblical,
and not specifically Mormon.  It is also called the sin against
the Holy Ghost.  Most Bible scholars (other than conservative
ones) do not believe Jehovah and Elohim were always the same.
I'm sure you've heard of the J and the E texts?  I don't

If I wanted to

science's higher probability of obtaining truth, that's why. Everywhere one

Truth by blatant assertion again, Frank. It's observationally the

assumed that it will work even when you are not measuring it, barring
quantum silliness about how it might have disappeared and reappeared.
It doesn't take a notion of objective reality to discuss my observations.
Well, I would add that the attribute ""works even when not being measured"" is
*ALSO* something which is valued and intended, Eric. All you've succeeded in

At this point in time we don't who destroyed the BDs.  Maybe it was the
government; maybe it was Koresh.  I wouldn't immediately rule out the
government just because the FBI said that a couple of cult members
torched Koresh's wood-frame house.  I think that the credibility of the
FBI and the cigarette cops is questionable at best; at worst they are
bald-faced liers.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the BDs that
survived the fire said that one of the tanks that crashed through their
wood-frame house knocked over a lantern which later on caused the
compound to errupt in flames.  Also, I have heard that one of the cult
members who earlier said that he and another individual started the fire
is no longer claiming that he did it.  Moreover, he and possibly the
other person may not have even really said that they did it in the
first place---we only have the FBI's WORD ON THIS.  I'll believe it when
I hear from a cult member's own mouth and not before then.
The FBI claims that they saw two cult members starting the fire.  They
claimed that the two were clad in black clothing and were wearing gas
masks.  Hmmm...  Sounds like they might have been describing an ATF
agent to me.  Weren't the cigarette cops wearing black?  Note:  this
is just speculation on my part.
Let me get this straight: your theory is that the FBI
accidentally started the fire while the ATF was deliberately starting
it?  That would certainly explain why they've been lying about the
whole thing -- that kind of screw-up really *would* be embarrassing,
wouldn't it?  There is of course only one weak spot in this theory --
we only have the FBI's WORD that the guys setting the fire were
wearing black, and you've already demonstrated that the FBI consists
of bald-faced liars.  From this we can immediately conclude that
they were not in fact wearing black, and that that description was
part of the FBI cover-up.  Who was it really?  Come on, now, think --
who is really out to embarrass the Clinton administration?  The
answer is so obvious I don't see how you could have missed it.
That's right -- it was Robert Dole and the Senate Republicans,
of course.  And it worked, too: Clinton immediately backed down on
the stimulus package, didn't he?
Still, it is something to think about.
Uh huh.
Later he writes:
[...] The tear gas cannisters---which do produce heat
despite what you may have been told by the media---may have contributed
to starting the blaze.
Now I'm getting confused.  Did the tear gas canisters start
the fire before or after the lantern, and when was that in relation to
when the ATF started it?  Oh, by the way, the story I've been hearing
is that no canisters were used, since they didn't want to start
a fire (but we of course only have their word on that).
As you may be able to tell, I'm not exactly persuaded.

Kent, let me explain it to you.
If you are paying for a phone, and you don't want call-waiting, YOU DON'T
This whole Clinton induced abortion debate SHOULD begin to make NARAL
nervous, because it has exposed a real scam.
If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
""abortion coverage"" there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it.  (Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesn't WANT that kind of coverage).
There are ""basic services"" and there are ""optional services"", Dennis. Call
waiting is an optional service, but having the number ""3"" work on one's phone
is a basic service. Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the ""3""
on his phone, since none of the numbers he calls has a ""3"" in it, doesn't mean
that he has the right to demand that the phone company ""unbundle"" the charges
for the use of each phone digit; an unbundling that would be horrendously
inefficient because of all the billing & bookkeeping overhead. Similarly,
abortion can be seen as a ""basic service"".
Furthermore, public funding of abortion SAVES money, as well as being, in the
views of a substantial portion of the population, probably a clear majority,
an ethical thing to do. If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that
way, why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities
with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion. If every pro-lifer did
the same, it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which
would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion. Then you
would get your wish. And, you know what? No pro-choicer I know would stop
you carrying out that plan. They might even HELP you with it...

Criminals mostly (70%) get (steal) their guns from people who buy them

need to to _reduce_, and not increse, the number of legally held guns.
Wrong, NYC subway breath.  Criminals are going to have guns regardless
of what legislative remedy you come up with.  However, it is the law-abiding
citizens who suffer when guns are harder to obtain.  Case in point:
Washington,
D.C. is the murder capital of the U.S., but has banned handguns and has some
of the most restrictive gun control laws in the nation.  They ain't working,
big brother Ray.
They don't work because you need a nation-wide confiscation of all guns,
Ralphie. That's why it dosen't work in D.C. They didn't confiscate the guns
that all ready exist. Therefore what Ray said still applies.
If only we could keep guns
out of criminals hands, we would just have a bunch of citizens getting
stabbed,
choke, and beaten to death.
However Ralphie, the amount of killings would go down. Think about it. With
guns it just takes the pull of a trigger. Other forms of murder require much
more effort on the part of the murderer.
In the UK, I read recently that some young women
have been killing even without guns (which are nearly impossible to obtain
there) and it is a cause of great concern to the Brits.  Well-armed citizens
mean that this country will never fear from the government, criminals or
invasion.  We may have twice the murder rate of the UK, but who gives a flip?
You should! Although maybe you're right. Well armed citizens wouldn't have
to worry about little boys and their threats against women and abortion
clinics.

and the U.S.  All these countries have a violent tradition.  Pure coincidence?
I doubt it.
Ralphie, only you in your sick mind would think that this is the reason Japan
and Germany's GNP are two of the highest. Probably had more to do with the
economic re-building after World War II. I think you need to study the issue
a little more. But in Ralphie's World, violence is to be worshipped. Isn't it

The problem is, Frank, that you are bringing your own _subjective_ values
into the debate and on the basis of those values you are making claim
to something that there is not any evidence (that I've seen, anyhow) to
support. This is not unsimilar to those people who make claims to
supernatural gods, not on the basis of fact, but because it makes them feel
better to think that they can minipulate their environment by influencing
those gods. It may be comforting, but is it real?
If you are going to claim that there is an absolute or objective morality,
the very first thing you have to do is demonstrate that morality itself
exists as something more than an abstraction. Only when you have done that
can we progress to debating whether this morality is absolute or not.
There have been many claims that morality is a component of reality, but
then again, there have been plenty of claims made by different folk over
the centuries. Claims, without fact to back them up are ultimatly very
hollow things.
So, having said that, I would ask you to begin by demonstrating that morality
is other than just an abstraction. Care to meet the challenge?

Perhaps you should read it and stop advancing the Bible as evidence relating
to questions of science.
[it = _Did Jesus exist?_ by G. A. Wells]
There is a great fallacy in your statement. The question of origins is
based on more than science alone.
Nope, no fallacy.  Yep, science is best in determining how; religions handle
why and who.
The problem is that most scientists exclude the possibility of the
supernatural in the question of origins.  Is this is a fair premise?
I utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of
truth.
If you met a man who could walk on
water, raise people from the dead, claimed to be the Son of God, and
then referred to the inviolability of the scriptures, this would affect
your belief in the origin of man.  (I can expand on this.)
Nope, wouldn't affect my knowledge (not belief) of origins of anatomically
modern humans.  If that man could show me something better, I'd change, even if
it was the biblical story in exact detail.  But then I would ask, ""Why in the
world did your father endow us with intellect and reason, and then proceed to
fool us.  I mean, the bible says nothing about the human-like creatures that we
know exist.
Some of these so-called human-like creatures were apes.  Some were
humans.  Some were fancifully reconstructed from fragments.
I doubt any of us will meet a man like this.  But, Bill, if your version of all
this is absolutely correct, I'm still no worried about my salvation.  I'll
probaby make it (I don't steal, murder, covet, etc, and I like to help other
people).  All I did was use the reason and intellect your god provided.
He or she - benevolent and loving - will understand my dilemma, don't you
think?
Good deeds do not justify a person in God's sight.
An atonement (Jesus) is needed to atone for sin.
Science and
the Bible are not in contradiction.  God can supercede the scientific
""laws"" as man understands them.  Creation is a good example.  God has the
power to create something out of nothing, order out of chaos.
Haven't been on t.o. long, but I have a feeling, Bill, that the veterans will
agree with you here.  No contradiciton, and god *can* do anything at will.  So,
what's the beef? (or more properly, ""where's"")
My point: God is the creator.  Look's like we agree.
If the title of the book you mentioned has anything to do with the
substance of the book, it must be a real laugher.  Of course Jesus existed,
and there are volumes of evidence to back it up.  I can give many if you
are interested.
Its not a laugher, Bill.  Its a scholarly book that many happen to disagree
with.  I am definitely (and seriously) interested in confirmation.  I know of
the bible, inferences therefrom (e.g., prophecies), apocrypha, the Koran and
others.  What I am interested is independent evidence.  Do you have any?  I
know of Josephus, but this is almost certainly an insertion.  Also I know of a
few Roman documents (e.g., Pliny), but these deal only with early Christians.
Do you have any independent evidence?  I am most interested.  Please Email or

too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the

the same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.
Because:
Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you
the right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for
everyone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like
yours, the ""I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you"" bullshit
that has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing,
and other atrocities by other people who, like you, ""knew"" they were

What is it with you, Hudson?  You think you know better than other people,
so you want to be able to tell them what they can and cannot do to

thing?
/(hudson)
/Aren't you?  Aren't you indicating that I should not tell other people what
to do?  Aren't you telling me it is wrong for me to do that?
It is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It is
a key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point of
respect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their
own choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other
hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether
they like it or not.
It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have
the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives,
then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of
interference in your life.
(Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that
only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.
However, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word of
God and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you are
acting on your own authority.  And so it goes).
(hudson)
/Who gave
/you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that I
/cannot set a moral standard for others?
You can set all the standards that you want, actually.  But don't be surprised
if people don't follow you like rats after the Pied Piper.
At the most basic form, I am not going to LET you tell me what to do;
and if necessary, I will beat you to a bloody pulp before I let you actually
interfere in my life.
Now, at a more humane level than that, I recognize that all people are
sentient beings possessed of intelligence and capable of reason.  I also
recognize that they, like I, appreciate being treated with respect and
allowed to make their own decisions.

o  What was called many months of *planning* was probably
the intelligence collecting: paperwork and interviews.
Nine months, as I understand it.  No doubt this accounts for a
significant amount of the time as government efficiency in spending
our tax dollars would certainly seek its absolute minimum in such
an event.  But my gut instinct says there is more at hand.  It took
some careful preplanning to demonize D.K. to such an extent.  The
attack meshes well with more restrictive gun control legislation
that seems to be the agenda of the day.  It also fits a pattern of
increased government interference in personal religious beliefs.
[Randy Weaver is now on trial].
o  It's important to them because it justifies budgets.
No quarrel here.  The BIG BANG theory is always apt at appropriation
time.  They just don't have to possess a single motive.
o  The warrant was sealed to keep from jeopardizing the
the government's case.
I certainly think publication of the warrant undermines the government's
case since it makes no claims of illegal action.  Therefore the federal
judge had reason to seal it.  But I am reminded of Senator Frank Church's
remark that ""secrecy is the trademark of a totalitarian government.""
There is rarely sufficient motive to seal a warrant in a nation of
free people.
o  There was probably no one actually exercising oversite.
Instead, a system of bureaucratic rules has been set
up for such incidents. Like computer programs -- these
have to be debugged periodically. Especially when used
in fringe areas. (cf. the ""hostage rescue"" program).
Therefore -- NO ONE WAS IN CHARGE. And no one can
reasonably be held responsible.
How can I argue with irrefutable logic?  I have long suspected that
the government has become a mindless machine and now you go and
confirm my worst fears!  Has it become a BEAST that is programmed
simply to say ""Kiss my toe and you get your piece of the pie?""

Now that has always confused me.  Once a black hole forms, I don't see
how
anything could pass the event horizon (perhaps including the original

Let's say that we drop a marble into the black hole.  It races, ever
faster, towards the even horizon.  But, thanks to the curving of space
caused by the excessive gravity, as the object approaches the event
horizon
it has further to travel.  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach
the
event horizon of . . .
infinity.  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole.
It seems to me that you are mis-using physical intuition here.  My point is
that you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomena
inappropriately.  Remember that there is no such thing as a ""global"" frame
of reference for time.  Our minds like to pretend that there is, and we
imagine things like the calendar on Alpha Centaury being approx. 4 years off
from ours on Earth.
This is simply wrong.  There is NO global ""time"" which can be applied to
events on Alpha Centaury concurrently with events on Earth.  This is what
Special Relativity has taught us.  If I am travelling past the Earth at
a high rate of speed toward A.C. I can even have a different view of the
_order_ of the occurance of events on A.C. versus Earth.  Thus, the answer to
the question, ""what's happening on Alpha Centaury NOW?"" is NOT well-defined, if
asked on Earth, until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relative
velocities and the like; AND it will have different answers for different
values of these parameters.
Now, in the vicinity of a black hole, the curvature of spacetime becomes
important enough that this lack of a global frame of reference becomes
very important.  In particular, the frame used by a distant observer is quite
different from the frame appropriate to the falling object.  Our minds just
don't seem able to easily deal with the idea that time itself could be
behaving differently in these two locations, but the equations of relativity
say that it does.  We would _like_ to say ""the falling object is hovering
above the horizon, NOW"", for an object whose frame has rotated wholly ""away""
from ours.  In a very real sense, once the object has fallen into the hole
its gone forever from our ken.  Unless you volunteer to jump in after it,
that is... :-)

(Jon Livesey):
If there is a Western ethic against infanticide, why

The majority of the world isn't ""Western"".
Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.
Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the
supposed ""Pro-Life"" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China.
And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.

objective worth, usefulness, or importance.  If nothing is inherently

"In article <C5KDzK.497@acsu.buffalo.edu, psyrobtw@ubvmsd.cc.buffalo.edu (Robert
Weiss) says:
Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to
differing interpretations of ""create,"" and say that many Christians may
not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith
on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is
truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.
I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy
meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is
indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word ""create""
is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.
Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
and eternally existent are equivalent, you say ""granted the Mormon
belief..."" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address
and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the
conclusion that you grant.
I should have said ""given the Mormon belief.""  If you disagree with the
Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally
existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important
point.
The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus
is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS
belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.
Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by
such terms.
The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is
nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible
says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:
It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they
believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and
Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or
organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being ""offspring"" of
God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually ""born again"" of
Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is
how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a
word is dangerous.
This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but
rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read
something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For
We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not
even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that
have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches,
you have to look at the Bible.
On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those
who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say
that one must simply ""look at the Bible"" to see what it teaches, but centuries
of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says.
Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the
scriptures?
I find this rather curious. When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is
that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late
apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the
issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his ""I
have my own conclusions"" to addressing the point.
Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief
that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We
keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of
Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)
Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of
Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't
think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the
issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this
subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may
certainly be.
On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon
canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great*
importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate
general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large
number of Mormons.

The result's actual truth is independent of what you think of it, if you
care to look at it that way - however your perception of a result's
truth cannot match its actual truth, unless you care to follow the (a?)
procedure to obtain truth (""science"") correctly.
Not true. Consider the case of a coin. I flip it and do not look
at it. It is either heads or tails. It is entirely possible
for me to simply choose to believe that it is heads or tails and
be right. Now, there is a procedure for ensuring(more or less)
that my belief will be correct, but it is quite possible for me
to be correct without following it.
You have to pick
the right procedure, and note its importance.  You've got to value it.
No, I don't. I can do perfectly good science without valuing
the procedure. But you're just overloading the term ""value""
again. Judgement of the validity of a procedure is not the
same as judgement of how preferable a certain action is, and
just because the word ""value"" can be applied to both doesn't
make it so. You might as well assert that ""number theory is
based on values.""
Otherwise you don't care about actual truth, and shouldn't object
to the statement ""objectivism is true"".
Huh? This is a complete non sequiter.
Now if we're valuing procedures subjectively, and science is a procedure,
science cannot be valued non-subjectively.
You're just overloading the word value, AGAIN, I suspect.
If we're picking facts
and hypotheses subjectively, then we are using a maybe-not-quite-sure
method on maybe-not-quite-sure observations.  That should lead
to maybe-not-quite-sure results, no?  The fact that it does not seem

I don't understand your point here. What do you mean by ""not quite-sure
observations?"" It gets observed all the time that if you don't
buy into a whole series of assumptions about how science is
done, the results become meaningless.
If you're suggesting that because science is allegedly chosen
'subjectively' the results have to be inconsistent, that's
silly.

"Would someone be kind enought to document the exact
nature of the evidence against the BD's without reference to
hearsay or newsreports. I would also like to know more about
their past record etc. but again based on solid not media

My reason for asking for such evidence is that last night
on Larry King Live a so-called ""cult-expert"" was interviewed from
Australia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to the
original raid. This admission, if true, raises the nasty
possibility that the Government acted in good faith, which I
believe they did, on faulty evidence. It also raises the
possibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advising
them and giving ver poor advice.
A few years ago Anson Shupe and David Bromley published

needs investigating in light of the Waco tragedy.

Also, while we're at it:
1. How do you reconcile ""A KIND and LOVING God!!"" with the

2. Is the fact the He no longer does this an admission on His part of

3. Now that we are ""living in the age of grace"", does this mean that
for our sins, God now damns us to eternal hell after we die, rather

velocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,
you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific
impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry
weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer...
Unfortunately, if you launch this from the US (or are a US citizen),
you will need a launch permit from the Office of Commercial Space

"In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid
rockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on
a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid
motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of
aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent
Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.
The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect
some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made
a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what
you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in
all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into
the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The
foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,
so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major
improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the
principal failure mode for solid propellant.

It was from a company name ""Personal Missle, Inc."" or something like that.
The company was probably ""Public Missiles, Inc"" of Michigan.
Anyhow, the ad stated that they'd sell rockets that were up to 20' in length
and engines of sizes ""F"" to ""M"".  They also said that some rockets will
reach 50,000 feet.
Yup.
Now, aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one
of these beasts, isn't this illegal?  I can't imagine the FAA allowing
people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes.
Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down.
Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to
purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be
one of the following:
a) An employee of a government agency.
b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.
c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in
research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:
The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.
Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction
and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.
The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any
organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions
to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:
- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the
location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.
- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft
within the operating radius around the launch site.
- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.
- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that
unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.
Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)
are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the
western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular
since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).
The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'
use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is
from 50 to 500 or more feet.
By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt from
most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart
C, for details.
As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to
50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical
rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,
or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry
either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches
in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.
Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.
And no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.
Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets
for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything
bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to
practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs

"There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's
LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it to
stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by
saying that I largely agree that the ""Space Age"" in the romantic sense
of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station
miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, ""What's New"" -
the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the
romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of
matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with
its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things
people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I
think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of
nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our ""mind
children"" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but
I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about
what we can do *now*.
Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...
Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)
At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a
midlife crisis.
The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no
longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion
-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic
rewards.
Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science
and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a
meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our
technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion
policy.
To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies
for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes
would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of
scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.
Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to
write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively
supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion
to build space station Freedom alone.
Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,
Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken
public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much
of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope
to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively
implemented did not seem to matter much.
Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent
vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar
space budgets.
Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo
era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration
with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.
While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel
Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being
positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's
technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been
slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions
its competitiveness agenda.
""I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen
now,"" says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA's Jet
Propulsion Lab in Pasadena.  ""We've put off a lot of things we shouldn't
have.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a
$40-billion one filled with white elephants.""

Doug-- Actually, if memory serves, the Atlas is an outgrowth of the old

Nope, you're confusing separate programs.  Atlas was the first-generation

Titan launchers are based on, was the third-generation heavy ICBM.  There
was essentially nothing in common between these three programs.
(Yes, *three* programs.  Despite the similarity of names, Titan I and
Titan II were completely different missiles.  They didn't even use the
same fuels, never mind the same launch facilities.)
If so, there's probably quite a few old pads, albeit in need

Sorry, the Titan silos (a) can't handle the Titan launchers with their

Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first,
but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that
of sky diving.
And what is the motion sickness
that some astronauts occasionally experience?
It is the body's reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be induced
partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress.  Some people are
more prone to it than others, like some people are more prone to get sick
on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental part is usually induced by
a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down, ie: the Shuttle is
normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards Earth, so the Earth

experience some form of motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in

They have a few problems. The biggest technical problem is the need to find
two satellites going to the same rough orbit for a luanch.
They also don't show much interest in commercial launches. There is more

There are a number of Philosophical questions that I would like to ask:
1)  If we encounter a life form during our space exploration, how do we
determine if we should capture it, imprison it, and then discect it?
Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few
years ago.  The question was, if an alien spacecraft landed in
Washington, D.C., what was the proper organization to deal with it: The
State Department (alien ambassadors), the Defense Department (alien
invaders), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (illegal aliens),
the Department of the Interior (new non-human species), etc.  It was
very much a question of our perception of the aliens, not of anything
intrinsic in their nature.  The bibliography for the article cited a
philosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I
believe the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral
person, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a
person.  The paper was quite interesting, as I recall.
2)  If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly, will
we expend resources from earth to help them?
I think you'd have to be very careful here if the answer is yes.  The
human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures (does
underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges?) is terrible.  The
usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the
culture.  This may not always be wrong, but that's the way to bet.
3)  With all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable,
what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought

Fine. I'll buy from George. GEORGEEE!!!!
That assumes I can't weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort (cut me a
break on the launcher, I'll cut you in on the proceeds if it works).  Only the
government pays higher-than-list price.
What's more, if you buy Titans, the prize money is your entire return on
investment.  If you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and
the prize is just the icing on the cake.
Unless you're Martin Marietta, since (as I recall) they bought out the GD line
of aerospace products.
If MM/GD does it as an in-house project, their costs would look much better
than buying at ""list price.""  Does anyone REALLY know the profit margins built
in to the Titan?  C'mon. Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this
or that...
I doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough
return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current
US launchers.
Oh please.  How much of a profit do you want?  Pulling $100-150 million after
all is said and done wouldn't be too shabby.  Not to mention the other goodies
I'll collect in:
a)  Movie & TV rights (say $100-150 million conservatively)
b)  Advertising       (""Look Mommie, they're drinking Coke!"")
c)  Intangibles	      (Name recognization, experience & data
acculumated)
You're going to *have* to invest your front money in building a new launch
system rather than pissing it away on existing ones.  Being there first is
of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it.
If you want lean, fine.  A $500 million prize would be more than adequate for a
prize.
Maybe Wales would be kind enough to define what a company would consider
a decent profit.
If you want R&D done, you'll have to write in R&D clauses.  I suppose you could
make it a SBIR set-aside :)

My understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically

that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't

Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a Proton/Centaur combo?
What would be the benefits and problems with such a combo (other
than the obvious instability in the XSSR now)?
I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau)
was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost
payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from
2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing
with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now
I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the
successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early
results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in
Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue
their development.
The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton
is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D
which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about
launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which
are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things
up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile
thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.
Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know
how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while
bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track
and erected on the pad?
They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads
(unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course
any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the
US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political
problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.

Bret,
If you are familiar with the software work that received the Level 5
rating, could you post a description of it and/or some references?  I
think many people would be interested to know just what the IBM team
on that effort is doing differently from most other organizations/projects
that earned them that rating.
I am familiar with the project.  It is the Onboard Shuttle Flight
Software Project.  This software controls the Space Shuttle During
all dynamic phases as well as on-orbit.
It has ultra-high reliability and extremely
low error rates.  There have been several papers published on the
subject and I'll collect some references.  There may be an
article in the IBM Systems Journal Late '93, early '94.
There is no magic formula.  We did it with dedicated and disciplined
folks who worked to put together a process that finds and removes errors
and is corrected based on errors that ""escape"".  We present a
one day overview of our process periodically to interested folks.
The next one is May 19th in Washington, D.C.  I can fax specifics
to those who are interested.

Indeed, the sky doesn't look much like a black body if you look carefully
enough; in particular, its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a
bit higher than you would see from a black body.  Morgan&Gordon's fat
""Communications Satellite Handbook"" has a graph of sky temperature vs.
wavelength, in fact, for communications design.
However, in terms of energy content, the RF frequencies are negligible.
For thermal purposes, at very large distances from the Sun the sky
looks like a black body at 3.5K (Allen, ""Astrophysical Quantities"").
I haven't found a number for non-large distances, since solar radiation
tends to be something you can't just ignore :-), but M&G says ""about 4K""
in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem.

Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon, once upon
a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered
a ""Goodyear Blimp in orbit"".  The idea was to use a large structure
that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has.
Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually
be seen by almost everyone on Earth.  Only our collective disapproval
of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing
it.  It had quite feasible economics, which I will not post here

"Question: what is the power spectrum of the bursts. Are their sharp lines?
If so, can they be interpreted as blue-shifted atomic or molecular lines?
Can electron-positron annihilation gammas be seen in the bursts? Are they
red shifted or blue shifted?
Since the bursts are isotropic and maybe in the galactic halo they may
be saying something about dark matter in the halo.
If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation from
way back then where are the red shifts - I mean cosmological red shifts?
Consider a wild idea - what if the bursts are advanced photons from the

from far future when universe was considerably more expanded get

I missed the presentations given in the morning session (when Shea gave

Shea didn't ""lead the formal presentation,"" in the sense of running
or guiding the presentation. He didn't even attend the afternoon

Shea's deputy, former astronaut Bryan O'Connor, will take over the effort.

WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC
In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published ""The
Man Who Sold the Moon,"" which involved a dispute over the sale of
rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this
hideous vision of the future.  Observers were
startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the
pad with ""SCHWARZENEGGER"" painted in huge block letters on the
side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged
for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie.
Well, if you're going to get upset with this, you might as well direct
some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well.  They pioneered
this capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA.
(Sign of the times: a Sony logo on a Soyuz launcher...)
Now, Space Marketing
is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on
a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth
orbit.
This sounds like something Lowell Wood would think of.  Does anyone
know if he's involved?
NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,
since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This
may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of
Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone
monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.
This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people.  My
guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to
build large, inflatable space structures.
What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore.
If this is true, I think it's a great idea.
Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential
step towards space development, and given that Freedom appears to be
shrinking towards the vanishing point, I question whether NASA's space
station is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area.
(Especially if a design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen...)
If such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates
creative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so
much the better.
Is NASA really supporting this junk?
And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the ""wild
idea"" stage or does it have real funding?
Are protesting groups being organized in the States?
Not yet.  Though, if this project goes through, I suppose The Return
of Jeremy Rifkin is inevitable...

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Contact:  OASIS (310) 364-2290
15 April 1993                                Los Angeles, CA
On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National
Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-
inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.
Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science
Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.
Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space
Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell
International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world
authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or
coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial
materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David
Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.
Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal
experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build
the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a
potential to power the globe.
For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half
from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific
concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.
The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar
surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted
through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous
source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever
increasing demand using proven, basic technology.
OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space
Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the
National Space Society, which is an international non-profit
organization that promotes development of the space frontier.
The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

originate in the solar cometary cloud
cannot be excluded until it is disproved.
This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,
anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.
That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution

I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans.
I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
of physical aspects of the planet.  The question is what physical aspects
simply disallow earth like conditions.
eg Temperature range of 280K to 315K (where temp is purely dependant on dist
from the sun and the suns temperature..)
Atmospheric presure ? - I know nothing of human tolerance
Planetary Mass ? - again gravity at surface is important, how much
can human bodies take day after day.  Also how does the mass effect
atmosphere.  I thinking of planets between .3 and 3 times mass of the
earth.  I suppose density should be important as well.
Climate etc does not concern me, nor does axial tilt etc etc.  Just the above
three factors and how they relate to one another.
Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled,
""Habitable Planets for Man"" (I think) in 1964.  It should be available
in most good libraries, or through inter-library loan.
It answered the questions you ask (speculatively, of course), along
with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies:
length of day (for day/night temperature variation, and agricultural
concerns), partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses (ever hear of
xenon narcosis?  neither did I), density of particulates in the atm, and
their composition (ever hear of silicosis?  not much fun), etc.
Climate isn't a global phenomenon and probably needn't concern you,
but axial tilt ought to.  It plays a large part in determining the
severity of seasonal differences, and a lesser but still significant
part in determining the speed of prevailing winds.

"Newsgroups: sci.astro,sci.space
Subject: Re: Vandalizing the sky.
My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but
got a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering
the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO
inalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive
of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out
of my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these
rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.)
Anyway, here are my thoughts on this:
I'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for
research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -
unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars
as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time
- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.
Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there
and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief
in an afterlife.
The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks
and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating
the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.
Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live
in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport
currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The
impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists
that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped
into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life
forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels
(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains
one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,
malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80
miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters
much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of
high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.
But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't
fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -
like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch
commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,
truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.
If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.
To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at
8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it
if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky
while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that
as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.
Regards,
Wm. Hathaway
Baltimore MD
(P.S. added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome,
just a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know
that other people may not accept it without a complaint.)

The Planetary Studies Foundation is sponsoring a one week class for
teachers called ""Space: Teaching's Newest Frontier."" The class will be
held at the Sheraton Suites in Elk Grove, Illinois from June 14 through
June 18. Participants who complete the program can earn two semester
hours of graduate credit from Aurora College. Please note that while the
class is intended for teachers, it is not restricted to teachers.
The class, which is being cosponsored by the United States Space
Foundation, will teach how to use space exploration as a teaching tool
to get students excited about learning and interested in science.
Classroom topics to be covered by the class include:
Living in Space
The Space Shuttle
The Space Station
NASA Spinoffs that Benefit Society
Principles of Astrodynamics/Aeronautics
The Solar System
There will also be simulated Zero-G training in an underwater space
station simulation, model rocket launches, observing sessions at the
Harper College Observatory, and field trips to the Adler Planetarium and
the Museum of Science and Industry.
Featured speakers include Jerry Brown of the Colorado based United
States Space Foundation and Debbie Brown of the NASA Lewis Research
Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Additional instructors will be provided by
the Planetary Studies Foundation.
The social highlight of the class will be a dinner banquet featuring
Space Shuttle Payload Specialist Byron Lichtenberg, currently President
of Payload Systems, Inc. Lichtenberg was a member of the crew of STS-9
which flew in November 1983. The banquet is scheduled for Thursday, June
The registration fee includes transportation for field trips, materials,
continental breakfasts, lunches, and the special dinner banquet. Guest
tickets for the dinner banquet are also available.  There is an

"Hi,
I was reading through ""The Spaceflight Handbook"" and somewhere in
there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them
when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to
the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he
estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not
be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published
in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very
long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in
fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of
course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?
Can this be extended to larger accelerations?
Thanks is advance...

SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software

only applies to the flight software.  Also keep in mind that it was
*not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather
through a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the
Challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and
did the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a 'Warning'
status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if
anything) from such a rating -- I'll have to get the latest copy of
the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).
Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with
control of the software process; the assumption is that a
well controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind
that SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.  Most software in this country is
produced by 'engineering practicies' that only rate an SEI Level 1 (if
that).

This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to
measure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process
by which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported
etc.
See `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison
Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of
software process maturity are:
1. Initial
2. Repeatable
3. Defined
4. Managed
5. Optimizing
The levels are approximately characterized as follows:
1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical
basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will
take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will
be.  Most software production is at this level.
2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project
management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects
are planned in detail, and there is software configuration
management and quality assurance.
3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is
consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a
rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,
and typically a `software engineering process group' within the
project.
4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered
and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this
information. Software quality is measured and has goals.
5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts
are effective and certified.

Sure, you can get a heavylift launcher fairly cheap if you do it privately
rather than as a gummint project.  But we're still talking about something
that will cost nine digits per launch, unless you can guarantee a large
market to justify volume production.

disregarding (or shielding against) the Sun and nearby large warm objects.
Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking ""If I put a blackbody
in interstellar space ('disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects'),
what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient
radiation field?""
If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and
molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far
from being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRAS
and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures
can range from 40K to 150K.  You might look in a conference proceedings
""Interstellar Processes"", ed. D. J. Hollenbach and H. A. Thronson, Jr.,
published in 1987.  Try the articles by Tielens et al., Seab, and
Black.
Inside the disk of the galaxy, the temperature varies quite a bit
from place to place (how close are you to the nearest OB association,
I would guess).  Outside the galaxy, of course, things aren't so
varied.
I hope this is what you were looking for....

"What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin
Mariatta, Boeing, Mcdonell Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Rockwell)
getting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market
price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say
$3million to do that.  Recognizing that most of the military requirements
for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle
ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure
out how many, how often, where to, etc...)
Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I
know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft
designs.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what
the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to
eliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that this
portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.
And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the
intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall
street, and saying ""I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers
that show %20 ROI, fund me...)
Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that
just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace
companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things
ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS,
ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european
spirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements
that are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be)
ends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.
Any feedback?

Programmatically, yes, we can land an Orbiter with a 5 cm hole in

cause a Crit 1 failure on some of the internal systems.  There are
a few places where a 5 cm hole would cause a Bad Day -- especially
if the 5 cm hole went all the way through the Orbiter and out the

I am afraid you are mis-directed. NeXTSTEP is an operating system as opposed to
a package. I have read a little about it but since Steve Jobs does not seem to
have the marketing capabilities of Bill Gates my info. is limited. Probably why
the far inferior Windows NT is going to be more widely distributed (but that
is another flame-ridden story). Some of the innovative features of NeXTSTEP are
binary compatibility across platforms (eg you can just copy your program from
a Sparc to a PC and it would run, as opposed to buying the version of the package
ported to a PC), graphical object-oriented design (its all WSIWIG postscript),
supports parallel hetrogeneous processing, and best of all it is based around
the Mach micro-kernel so you can make it look like Unix with X, or DOS, or NT or
even VMS if you feel the need. No package out there comes even close. I hope
people will subscribe to the HyperKnowledge project and NeXTSTEP finally
takes off in my lifetime :-)

You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy

taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street
outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)
However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of
streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only
illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a
bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level
is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected
local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable
success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At
least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago.
( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )
I suppose that the ""right"" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration,
but it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially
yukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, although
I do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing.

I don't care who told you this it is not generally true. I see EVERY single
line item on a contract and I have to sign it. There is no such thing as
wrap at this university.
Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions
of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and
non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much
of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors.
The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and
even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL
charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA
commercialization centers; they charge a fee.
Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack
experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand
the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack
of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it
is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't
a flame, jsut a statement.
Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.
Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate. Go ask your
costing people how much fee they add to a project.
I did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that
any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.
Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in
their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can
change depending on the customer.
No Allen you did not. You merely repeated allegations made by an Employee
of the Overhead capital of NASA.
Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.
Nothing that Reston does could not be dont
better or cheaper at the Other NASA centers  where the work is going on.
Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When
WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where
doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the
only place you would find people actually interested in solving the
problems and building a station.
Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is
at a place where everything is overhead.
When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that
integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part
of a successful large scale effort.
Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally
demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being
selective with the facts again.
The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on
Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers
you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address
the problems until the press published the story.
Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address
the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?
If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost
of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your
""friend"" at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it
for a billion a year ""if the wrap were gone"". This merely points out a
blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.
You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for
resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying
is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.
Sorry gang but I have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going
to have to do Allen's math for him for a while. I will have little chance to
do so.
I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of
Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.

Apart from the fact that you get G in the pull-out, not the dive, that

The duration of G, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are
all critical parts of the equation. I remember one note about instrumented
gridiron players recording peaks about 200G. Stapp, the aviation doctor,
either by accident or design, took a short-period 80G in a rocket-sled
decelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. It had
to be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at that
G. A bang-seat can get up to about 60 G, and you'd better be sitting
straight. Find the book by Martin-Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad
it can get if the rate of onset is too high. A reclining position and a
good G-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G.
A flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a
fluid, and high-pressure situations are not new. Anyone have any figures?

"NASA Headquarters distributed the following press
release today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you
folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently
discussed on sci.space are covered in this.
Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance
Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and
Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of
the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space
Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to
the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of
the space station.
A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7
billion and a high option of $9 billion will be
considered by the committee. Each option would cover
the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for
development, operations, utilization, Shuttle
integration, facilities, research operations support,
transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the
available funds.
Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within
the NASA budget for the President's new technology
investment. As a result, station options above $7
billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in
the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space
station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion
in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.
Gibbons presented the information at an organizational
session of the advisory committee. Generally, the
members-designate focused upon administrative topics
and used the session to get acquainted. They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation
on the process the Station Redesign Team is following
to develop options for the advisory committee to
consider.
Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and
Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give
""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the
course of the space station redesign process.
To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate
in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting
basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their
expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the
possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and
systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to
benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants
in assessing Russian systems and technology. The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop
options for reducing station costs while preserving key
research and exploration capabilities. Careful
integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in
achieving that goal.
Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is
committed to the redesigned space station and to making
every effort to preserve the science, the technology
and the jobs that the space station program represents.
However, he also is committed to a space station that
is well managed and one that does not consume the
national resources which should be used to invest in
the future of this industry and this nation.""
NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian
participation will be accomplished through the East-
West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland
under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.
